# Workstation roadmap

## H-080 — Progressive Operational Compilation — H-080A PRODUCTION-PATH QUALIFICATION / H-080B EXPERIENCE LOOP OPEN (2026-09-22)

Canonical current audit:
[context/engineering-journal/h080-production-path-audit-2026-09-22.md](context/engineering-journal/h080-production-path-audit-2026-09-22.md).

Implementation branch at audit:
`integration/upstream-20260922-71a2fe39-h0793@89a745d2ee0346c7030134c10b24071ce9e234f1`.

Frozen upstream pin remains:
`71a2fe399bbd7a219c71f9d9fca2b313b01f2057`, true-merged by `a8dfcd21f5c641d01a5989e223a987687018db7f`.

Latest upstream observed in the production-path audit:
`d3b25b52ad1318c526bdb259b600eeca3d5f38e6`.
Delta from the frozen pin is 23 commits with no overlap in the four H-080 upstream intervention owners; classification is `NON_OVERLAPPING` at this snapshot and must be repeated immediately before promotion.

### Accepted / already repaired

- generic pre-reasoning boundary under `agent/` remains the correct architecture;
- no direct generic-core -> Workstation import for this concern;
- established typed/durable intent remains required;
- E001 no longer starts from an already-satisfied goal;
- verifier-failure E2E is implemented rather than `pass`;
- `upstream_interventions.json` now contains only four upstream-owned interventions with corrected feature provenance;
- `SEAM-OPERATIONAL-RESOLUTION` is registered as `UPSTREAM_ABSTRACT`;
- Browser routing/projection authority remains accepted and focused exactly-once/fallback/fail-closed tests exist.

Do not redesign or revert this lane.

### H-080A — production-path closure (qualified locally 2026-09-23)

All code blockers are closed; only exact-head CI remains:

1. **Production authority bridge implemented.**
   `workstation/integrations/hermes/effect_authority.py` derives a
   LOCAL_MUTATION ceiling from trusted ingress (envelope + canonical
   task/session binding). `_dispatch_intent` sets
   `compiler.trusted_authority` from it. No TaskCompiler monkeypatch remains
   in the release E2E. Covered by
   `workstation/tests/test_operational_effect_authority.py` (13 tests).

2. **Real durable dispatcher proven separately (E001D).**
   `test_durable_dispatcher_parity` drives the real
   `workstation_durable_dispatch` → `execute_tool_calls_sequential` →
   real `todo_list` handler → real `TodoStore` (revision +1, exactly one
   execution, raw-result path exercised). Only spies observe; nothing is
   replaced.

3. **Causal evidence asserted directly (E001F).**
   `test_known_promoted_capability_bypasses_llm` proves via TaskCompiler
   result spy: `EXECUTE`, non-empty certificate, `VERIFIED` + accepted,
   `COMMITTED`, real tmp filesystem mutation, zero provider calls.

4. **No pre-seeded success evidence.**
   Objectives carry only observation *configuration* (`verification_expected`,
   `observer_args`, `observed_predicates`, lineage). The kernel's real
   `fs_read` observer produces evidence post-effect. E003VF proves a real
   content mismatch yields FAILED, no COMMITTED success, no blind retry.

5. **Scratch fixture absorbed and removed.**
   `test_zz_scratch_route_fixture.py` deleted; its certified-route proof now
   lives in the normal-turn E001F/E003VF suites.

6. **Truthful metrics wired minimally.**
   Generic counters now distinguish `executed`/`satisfied`/`wait`/`handoff`/
   `continue_reasoning`; only `executed` (contract: VERIFIED + accepted)
   counts as deterministic verified resolution. Unknown denominators remain
   `None` (no invented zeros).

7. **Exact-head remote qualification pending.**
   Open PR and record GitHub CI evidence on the final head.

### H-080A mandatory correction order

```text
merge current main docs/state into feature branch
-> create/use a trusted production AuthorityScope bridge
-> remove TaskCompiler authority monkeypatch from release E2E
-> exercise real workstation_durable_dispatch through a real admitted safe primitive
-> expose non-authoritative causal observability
-> assert EXECUTE/certificate/VERIFIED/accepted/COMMITTED directly
-> assert verifier failure is not COMMITTED and never blindly retried
-> absorb/rename scratch test
-> truthful metrics wiring
-> focused + Browser + strict seam + full Workstation/upstream-owner qualification
-> final upstream drift classification
-> PR
-> exact-head GitHub CI
-> promote H-080A only if green
```

### H-080B — Experience feedback-loop closure

Remains OPEN. It requires a single E2E proving:

```text
novel verified execution
-> TransitionSample / ExperienceCorpus
-> compile
-> controlled replay / causal validation
-> verifier validation
-> ExperiencePromotionPolicy
-> promoted capability
-> future normal turn
-> EXECUTE / VERIFIED / COMMITTED
-> provider calls = 0
```

H-080A may close independently if scoped truthfully. Do not describe Progressive Operational Compilation as end-to-end closed until H-080B is proven.

Laya remains deferred to System-1/shadow/shortlist work after H-080A qualification; it has no execution, authority, verification or promotion power.

## H-079.2 — Upstream Re-adoption + Dogfood Installer Closure (2026-09-20) — LOCAL QUALIFICATION GREEN / EXACT-HEAD CI PENDING

Canonical:
[context/H079_2_UPSTREAM_DOGFOOD_CLOSURE_2026-09-20.md](context/H079_2_UPSTREAM_DOGFOOD_CLOSURE_2026-09-20.md).

The previous H-079 lane produced a healthy core baseline, but a repository audit plus real one-click dogfood run exposed a promotion gap:
- current `main@964c13361e...` has exact-head Workstation CI green: **743 passed**, **327 core seam regressions passed**, canary and core-patch dry-run green;
- the attempted upstream refresh to `8d153b26...` landed only in `integration/upstream-20260920-8d153b26-h0791`, so the latest upstream pin actually ancestral to `main` remains `c1488ac947...`;
- current observed upstream is `641f7c8104...`; `main` is 547 ahead / 622 behind with merge-base `c1488ac947...`;
- `workstation/install.ps1` still fails on an existing supported `.venv` without pip (`No module named pip`);
- the semantic installer fix, pipless regression fixture, and negative H-077 ACK-without-delta test exist only on the abandoned integration branch;
- Windows product evidence is broad, but the workflow remains red because POSIX/macOS tests are executed under Windows; this must be corrected rather than waived as release-qualified.
- Anthropic integration proof remains partial: CI installs the optional extra, but the provider-routing test still mocks `build_anthropic_client`; retain the unit test and add one real no-network SDK construction contract.

Required order:
```text
fresh upstream pin -> true-history merge -> seam reconciliation
-> re-adopt pipless installer + H-077 negative regression
-> platform-correct Windows qualification -> full exact-head gates
-> final drift classification -> PR -> main
```

The fresh `118984d7a02f...` pin is now a true ancestor through merge commit `3d1c18752975...`. Installer A–F behavior, H-077, Anthropic construction, full Workstation, Desktop, H004, sustained H013 and Work100 are locally green. Promotion and new downstream feature work remain blocked until the exact final PR head has all required GitHub checks green and the final upstream drift check is classified.


## H-079 — Upstream-First Change Gate / Qualified Baseline Discipline (2026-09-20) — PRIMARY POLICY / ACTIVE

Canonical:
[context/UPSTREAM_FIRST_CHANGE_GATE_2026-09-20.md](context/UPSTREAM_FIRST_CHANGE_GATE_2026-09-20.md).

From this point forward, **every downstream code-change cycle starts with upstream
preflight and, when upstream advanced, a separate baseline synchronization/qualification
stage before the target implementation begins**.

Required order:

```text
upstream fetch -> exact SHA pin -> true baseline merge
-> seam reconciliation -> baseline qualification
-> target change -> target qualification -> final drift check
```

Do not chase a moving HEAD inside the feature. Pin one SHA for the cycle. Do not combine
an unqualified upstream merge and the requested feature into an opaque patch.

Qualified baseline snapshot (2026-09-20; qualification applies only to the recorded SHA):
- observed downstream `main`: `9e8127e247...`;
- adopted upstream pin: `c1488ac947...` (true two-parent merge in `24a8501934...`);
- superseded pin: `b7d7d2929a...`, adopted by `a13929fb35...` on the H-079 candidate and replaced when `24a8501934...` landed;
- merge ancestry verified: `git merge-base 9e8127e247 2c0b2a980c` -> `c1488ac947...`;
- drift at `9e8127e247...` versus upstream snapshot `2c0b2a980c...`: 544 downstream-only and 447 upstream-only commits;
- H-079 Stage A (Upstream Baseline Sync) and Stage B (H-078C Corrective Closure) are merged to `main`.

**The baseline is qualified at exact head.** `9e8127e247...` — the head PR #41 merged, carrying the
browser-routing-ladder fix `1716062f32...` — passes `Workstation CI` (job `contracts`, run
`35536129052`). The red run was at `d0ade123c0...`, which that fix supersedes. This evidence does
not automatically qualify later branch or main heads. Aggregate browser convergence is
**UNMEASURED**: no named acceptance check is cited for the former `FULL` claim; the narrower
browser-authority evidence below remains separate.

### H-078C post-merge closure items — CLOSED / PROMOTED TO MAIN

The open qualification debt from H-078C was resolved on the H-079 integration candidate and
promoted to `main`:
- **Runtime Independence**: Root-caused suite-order import contamination; fresh-process test proves AlternateReasoner runs with 0 `run_agent` imports.
- **Browser AppView Core Patch Anchor**: Anchor in `apply_core_integration.py` updated to contemporary Desktop layout; dry-run passes.
- **BrowserControlBroker Authority**: Generic `browser_tool` routes through `browser_extension_router` -> `BrowserControlBroker` -> `WorkstationBrowserController`; legacy router downgraded to non-authoritative compatibility adapter.
- **Tool Batch Admission**: Owned exclusively by `agent/turn_tool_round.py` with explicit admission marker; duplicate execution eliminated.
- **Adapter Bootstrap**: Silent try-except pass replaced by explicit fail-closed bootstrap when Workstation supervision is expected.
- **Desktop & Native Browser**: H004 native probe VALIDATED, Desktop typecheck 0 errors, Desktop build green, H013 3/3 passed.
- **Full Workstation Suite**: 741 passed, 2 skipped, 1 warning (291s).
- **Seams Audit**: 18 classified, 0 unclassified, 0 budget regressions.

These items were promoted to `main` in `24a8501934...`. Exact-head CI verification was subsequently
performed: it was **red** at `d0ade123c0...` for the `BrowserRoutingPolicy` ladder regression
described above, and is **green** at the qualified head `9e8127e247...`. The H-078C closure items
themselves were not implicated in either run.


## H-078B — Code-to-Code Migration & Semantic Decoupling (2026-09-19) — COMPLETE / VERIFIED

The H-078B Code-to-Code Upstream Migration / Semantic Decoupling has been fully implemented and
empirically validated.

Key achievements:
- **Core Decoupling (Zero Direct Imports)**: `run_agent.py`, `agent/conversation_loop.py`,
  `agent/tool_executor.py`, `agent/turn_finalizer.py`, `agent/turn_constraints.py`,
  `agent/chat_completion_helpers.py`, `agent/conversation_compression.py`, `cli.py`,
  `gateway/run.py`, `hermes_cli/kanban_db.py`, `hermes_cli/web_server.py`, `tools/file_tools.py`,
  `tools/tool_search.py`, and `tools/close_preview_tool.py` now have exactly **0** direct imports
  from `workstation`.
- **Generic Core Abstractions**: Added generic, upstream-safe extension points in `agent/`:
  `turn_ingress.py`, `turn_admission.py`, `tool_batch_admission.py`, `scoped_execution.py`,
  `pre_dispatch.py`, `post_tool.py`, `execution_persistence.py`, `turn_route_policy.py`,
  `completion_admission.py`, `compression_admission.py`, `conversation_projection.py`,
  and `task_completion_admission.py`.
- **First-Party Workstation Adapter**: Established `workstation/integrations/hermes/` wiring all
  Workstation capabilities through generic registries (`install_workstation_adapter`).
- **Seam Policy Audit**: Strict policy audit passes with 0 unclassified seams and 0 budget
  regressions (`audit_hermes_seams.py --strict`).
- **Runtime Independence Verified**: An alternate reasoner (`AlternateReasoner`) successfully
  drives the Workstation runtime through all lifecycle boundaries with zero imports from `run_agent.py`.
- **Qualification Ladder Green**: Passed full regression suites including H-077.1 qualification
  closure (`test_h0771_qualification_closure.py`), architectural falsification (`test_architectural_falsification.py`),
  control plane integration (`test_control_plane_integration.py`), canonical work loop & continuity
  (`test_canonical_work_loop.py`, `test_canonical_continuity.py`), durable agent integration
  (`test_durable_agent_integration.py`), and seam tests (`test_h078b_generic_seams.py`, `test_h078b_runtime_independence.py`).

2. refresh/pin one upstream SHA and create a separate integration branch;
3. adopt upstream decomposition first; do not preserve old god-files as owners;
4. create `workstation/integrations/hermes/` or equivalent first-party plugin façade;
5. add generic `turn_admission`, `tool_batch_admission`,
   `pre_authorized_dispatch`, execution-persistence disposition and
   `completion_admission`;
6. generalize `TurnRoutePolicy`, trusted `TurnIngress` and
   `TaskCompletionAdmission`;
7. port Progressive Compilation/human handoff/route authority out of `run_agent.py`;
8. move post-tool mutation/raw-result learning to raw `post_tool_call`;
9. converge Browser routing on `BrowserControlBroker` with a generic capability registry;
10. move Workstation APIs and `work_execute` registration into plugin surfaces;
11. concentrate remaining Desktop native seams into bootstrap + typed IPC bridge;
12. switch authority seam-by-seam only after parity; mutation shadow must never execute a
    duplicate effect.

Canonical causal invariant:

```text
final args -> authorization/guards -> uncertain checkpoint -> REAL I/O
-> raw post_tool_call -> spill/truncate/persist
```

Canonical completion invariant:

```text
prepare -> ownership snapshot -> txn -> revalidate -> acceptance receipt -> DONE
```

The v2 seam registry is now semantic: mixed files such as `tool_executor.py` contain
concerns with independent dispositions and sunset conditions.


## H-078 — Upstream Migration as Decoupling / Minimum Necessary First-Party Seams (2026-09-19) — ACTIVE STRATEGIC LANE

Canonical program:
[context/UPSTREAM_MIGRATION_AS_DECOUPLING_2026-09-19.md](context/UPSTREAM_MIGRATION_AS_DECOUPLING_2026-09-19.md).

Seam policy:
[context/FIRST_PARTY_SEAM_POLICY.md](context/FIRST_PARTY_SEAM_POLICY.md).

Decision: **adapt Hermes Work to the current upstream while removing accidental coupling
and minimizing first-party seams without sacrificing capability, lifecycle control,
correctness or integrated UX.**

The target is not "zero source changes". The Reasoner and generic agent core should avoid
Workstation-specific knowledge where generic hooks/middleware/providers can preserve the
same semantics. The first-party Hermes Work Desktop may deliberately retain narrow native
integration seams when plugin/extension surfaces cannot provide equivalent behavior.

Every upstream overlap:
`ADOPT_UPSTREAM | KEEP_WORKSTATION | SEMANTIC_PORT | EXTRACT_BOUNDARY`.

Every remaining first-party seam:
`REMOVE | UPSTREAM_ABSTRACT | PRESERVE_FIRST_PARTY`.

The Browser is the reference case: use modern upstream Plugin SDK/pane surfaces for UI
integration when they preserve parity, but do not sacrifice the persistent native
`WebContentsView`, BrowserTask ownership, background continuity, human takeover, fencing,
Hub/Chat transfer or recovery merely to make the downstream diff smaller.

Sequence:
P0 seam policy + registry -> P1 pinned upstream baseline migration -> P2 supervisory adapter
shadow mode -> P3 tool-execution minimization -> P4 turn/finalizer minimization -> P5
Browser generic boundary + justified native seams -> P6 Session/Kanban/API/Desktop edge
minimization -> P7 Work Gateway -> P8 Hermes-less qualification.

Gate: **shadow parity before seam removal; evidence before seam preservation.** A seam may
remain only when its first-party privilege is materially necessary, concentrated,
documented, tested and re-evaluated on every upstream cycle.

Canonical rule:

```text
UPSTREAM STRUCTURE
+ WORKSTATION SEMANTICS
+ MINIMUM NECESSARY FIRST-PARTY SEAMS
+ NO CAPABILITY REGRESSION FOR PURITY
```

H-077 remains orthogonal: it governs external validity/truth claims; H-078 governs how the
first-party Workstation integrates with Hermes while moving toward Runtime Independence.

## H-077.1 — Truthful Core Qualification Closure (2026-09-19) — IMPLEMENTED / QUALIFIED

## H-077 — Architectural Falsification / External Validity (2026-09-19) — QUALIFIED

Canonical:
[context/H077_1_QUALIFICATION_CLOSURE_2026-09-19.md](context/H077_1_QUALIFICATION_CLOSURE_2026-09-19.md).

Post-merge audit of PR #36 retained the H-077 architecture but reopened qualification.
Blocking sequence: terminal truth/counters -> observation receipt + lineage -> fail-closed
validity-envelope reuse admission -> adjudicated external metrics -> AFB-v0.1 hidden-oracle
harness -> automatic model inadequacy -> exact-head qualification.

Do not introduce new horizontal registries/services to close these seams.

## H-077 — Truthful Core, AFB-v0 & External Validity (2026-09-19) — CORE IMPLEMENTED / QUALIFICATION PARTIAL

PR #36 remains the implementation baseline. Routing/ORA correction, fail-closed
conditions, resource/operation binding, boolean-verifier fail-close, external-validity
metric substrate, model-inadequacy metadata, pure ValidityEnvelope projection and the
no-new-primitives gate remain valid.

Qualification is reopened because TaskCompiler can close ACK/non-VERIFIED results,
evidence provenance is still partly inferred from contract requirements, task/run
lineage is not enforced, the validity envelope is not yet a fail-closed reuse gate,
external metrics can hide low oracle coverage, AFB-v0 is not yet a generated external
harness, model-inadequacy integration is incomplete, and generic success/replay counters
can remain optimistic.

Historical PR #36 pass receipts remain regression evidence, not closure evidence.

## Verification Contract Synthesis / Operational Truth (2026-09-19) — H-076 IMPLEMENTED & QUALIFIED

Canonical specification:
[context/VERIFICATION_CONTRACT_SYNTHESIS_2026-09-19.md](context/VERIFICATION_CONTRACT_SYNTHESIS_2026-09-19.md).

Post-PR #33 audit on main@e010c8981a4bdeb89ac94479e0d7e891d48eadae
falsified the need for a separate Verifier Compiler but confirmed an epistemic
verification gap. H-075 now transfers verified adaptive work to deterministic owners;
H-076 defines what may legitimately count as VERIFIED.

Historical pre-H-076 seams resolved by PR #34 included undeclared verifier-strength
promotion, presence-based verifier admission, assumed freshness, executor self-report,
correlated semantic observation, shallow RunClosure verifier admission and loss of
verifier identity/validation detail. H-077 tracks only post-qualification residuals.

P0-P7: eliminate false-confidence seams; typed VerificationContract +
VerificationResult evaluator; runtime integration; RunClosure/Await integration;
Verification Contract Synthesis; negative-control/verifier-sensitivity validation;
action+oracle pair promotion/metrics; extend the existing Trello-shaped benchmark with
truth/adversarial cases.

H-075 remains implemented. H-076 hardens verification without a second registry,
scheduler, evidence store or control plane. Receipts: 109 focused tests and full
Workstation **670 passed, 2 skipped**.

## In-Flight Operationalization / Adaptive-to-Deterministic Handoff (2026-09-19) — IMPLEMENTED & QUALIFIED (Phases P0–P6)

Canonical specification:
[context/IN_FLIGHT_OPERATIONALIZATION_2026-09-19.md](context/IN_FLIGHT_OPERATIONALIZATION_2026-09-19.md).

H-075 closed the In-Flight Operationalization Handoff Gap (KI-014) and remaining operational hierarchy seams (KI-013) across Phases P0–P6:
- P0: Decision seams (`WaitDecision`, `HumanDecision`, `ReasoningDecision`, `ComposedDecision`) consume real dataclass fields; composition requires authoritative final-goal verification; conservative derivation fails closed.
- P1: `RunClosureProof` with 21 canonical fields, 10 admission conditions in `evaluate_run_local_closure()`, positive expected operational utility threshold.
- P2: Adaptive-to-compiled handoff transferring remaining batch to `DurableBatchRunner` without LLM re-entry; `RunScopedCapability` excluded from global promoted index; prefix recovery prevents duplicate mutation replay.
- P3: Browser lowering replaces console scripts with `plain_text_paste` for rich editors; `resolve_browser_type_text()` resolves `text_ref`/`artifact_ref` at trusted boundary with task fencing, <=1MB size, and MIME validation.
- P4: Durable `CapabilityInvocation` with lineage in `ArtifactStore` and `ExecutionJournal`; `load_invocations()` verifies pins/drift; composite promotion enforces causal replay and counterexample verification (`ExperiencePromotionPolicy`).
- P5: Non-resident `WaitDecision` persists `AwaitCondition` + `AwaitContinuation` in `AwaitConditionStore` and releases worker processes; production `ORAMetrics` wired directly into `OperationalKernel` and `TaskCompiler`.
- P6: 12-item Trello-shaped benchmark qualified end-to-end with canary + replay, handoff of 10 items, large artifact ref resolution, deliberate anomaly handling with `AttentionPacket`, prefix recovery, and clean resume without duplicate replays.

Evidence: 21 in-flight operationalization tests passed; full workstation test suite: **647 passed, 2 skipped in 287.92s**.


## Browser Operational Admission corrective P0 (2026-09-19) — IMPLEMENTED; EXACT-HEAD CI PENDING

H-071 closes P0-A through P0-H in the existing owners: real ordered composition,
evidence-gated commit, trusted authority only, explicit operational closure, native
same-origin HTTP readback without process fallback, owner-declared terminal identity,
repaired integration anchor, and a real Electron rich-editor/cookie/drift/replay fixture.
Local candidate gates are green; final `QUALIFIED` status awaits exact-head CI.

## Hierarchical Operational Learning / Reasoning Amortization (2026-09-18) — COMPONENT BASELINE LANDED & SEAMS CLOSED [H-075]

Canonical specification:
[context/HIERARCHICAL_OPERATIONAL_LEARNING_2026-09-18.md](context/HIERARCHICAL_OPERATIONAL_LEARNING_2026-09-18.md).

The 2026-09-18 architecture audit established that the desired direction is not a
replacement for Progressive Operational Compilation, Experience Compiler or the
Verified Operational Control Plane. It is the missing hierarchy that connects them:

~~~text
Trusted primitives
  -> Verified Operational Transition (VOT)
  -> OperationalCapability
  -> Composite OperationalCapability
  -> Deterministic Workflow
  -> Await/Event
  -> OpenCondition / reasoning boundary
~~~

The canonical atomic rule is **smallest semantically closed, parameterizable,
executable and verifiable transition with positive reuse value**, not smallest tool
sequence. This prevents micro-capability explosion while preserving increasingly
high-level reuse.

PR #32 component baseline (620 tests were reported at implementation time; H-075 supersedes the end-to-end CLOSED/QUALIFIED claim):

1. **P0 — Truthful Control Plane closure (SUBSTANTIAL BASELINE / CORRECTIVE SEAMS OPEN).**
   CompositionCertificate hash method, CertifiedDispatcher fail-closed verification
   (NEEDS_VERIFICATION), TaskCompiler sequential child execution without synthetic
   wildcards, operational-closure-aware execution policy, terminal family narrowing.
2. **P1 — Experience Compiler -> Router bridge (BASELINE LANDED / PROVENANCE HARDENING OPEN).**
   Provenance extended with authority_ref and authority_scope; conservative deterministic
   CapabilityFormalContract derivation from verified experience; family_id indexing;
   OperationIntent routing to promoted learned capabilities without LLM.
3. **P2 — Non-resident Await/Continuation (COMPONENT CONTRACT LANDED / PRODUCT RESUME OPEN).**
   AwaitContinuation with durable subgraph and capability pins; TriggerCoordinator with
   run_id/task_id/operation_id fencing, authoritative state confirmation before wake,
   and atomic condition cleanup only after verified resumption.
4. **P3 — Hierarchical Experience Compiler (SUBSTRATE LANDED / DURABLE CAUSAL PROMOTION OPEN).**
   OperationalKernel records verified CapabilityInvocation; HierarchicalExperienceCompiler
   mines recurring sequences across runs, validates causal/authority/verifier JOIN closure,
   and emits composite OperationalCapabilities preserving child dependencies (no flattening).
   Child drift or quarantine fails closed and strictly blocks composite execution.
5. **P4 — Operational Reasoning Amortization metrics (SCHEMA LANDED / PRODUCTION TELEMETRY OPEN).**
   ORAMetrics implemented with ora_ratio, composite_reuse_rate, wait_non_residency_rate,
   wake_llm_rate, and WakeReason breakdown. All unknown denominators strictly preserved
   as None / null without synthetic figures.

Target hard properties — H-075 requires end-to-end proof before these are called closed:
- promoted learned capabilities become Router-visible only from provable typed
  contracts; missing proof fails closed;
- composite plans cannot commit unless actually executed and verified;
- persistent waits survive restart and do not retain an idle worker;
- repeated capability sequences may propose composites but passive recurrence is
  never causal proof;
- child drift/version changes propagate through composite pins/contracts;
- no second registry, scheduler, task DB, BrowserTask store, journal, memory system
  or control plane is introduced.

Optimization target:

> **As Hermes accumulates verified experience, the proportion of operational work
> that requires fresh LLM reasoning should decrease, without weakening evidence,
> authority, drift handling or uncertainty semantics.**


## Browser Ownership & Recovery Reconciliation (2026-09-19) — IMPLEMENTATION LANDED / CORRECTIVE P0 REOPENED

Canonical specification:
[context/BROWSER_OWNERSHIP_RECOVERY_RECONCILIATION_2026-09-18.md](context/BROWSER_OWNERSHIP_RECOVERY_RECONCILIATION_2026-09-18.md).

The 2026-09-18 implementation remains a strong baseline: shared native-view occlusion,
host fencing, `preferredTaskId` plumbing, task-bound lazy recovery, cross-session
isolation and visibility-vs-execution projection all landed with useful focused
regressions. A post-implementation audit of current `main@6328894c0a5f51a61da772593842c25d377d553f`
found that the milestone was promoted to CLOSED before the renderer/product path and
cleanup semantics were fully proven.

Corrective P0 sequence:
1. **Make Clear Parked execution-aware.** Bulk clearing must never destroy a task that
   is `working`, `waiting` or under `human_control`. The current UI hides/protects
   working tasks visually, but runtime `clearParkedTasks()` still destroys every
   lifecycle task whose status is `parked`.
2. **Resolve the chat task before first visual attach.** On cold renderer mount/restart,
   `WorkstationBrowserPane` starts with `state.tasks=[]` and can call
   `attach(bounds, 'chat', undefined)` before discovering the restored BrowserTask.
   Avoid any transient foreground `about:blank` by obtaining/reconciling task identity
   before the first native viewport attach.
3. **Prove the real renderer/restart sequence in H013.** Extend the integrated
   Electron/Desktop path to cover Chat A/Browser A -> Chat B/Browser B -> process
   restart -> renderer mount -> restore B -> switch A, including
   `preferredTaskId`, stale host cleanup and one-page-per-task invariants.
4. **Close session alias coverage.** Add behavioral proof for `parent_session_id`
   together with live id and `_lineage_root_id`; the current BrowserPane resolver
   primarily consumes `lineageAliases()`, which does not itself encode
   `parent_session_id`.
5. **Finish the explicit occlusion contract.** Prefer
   `[data-native-view-occluder="true"]` as the authoritative selector; generic
   `role="menu"`, `role="dialog"` or slot selectors should not independently gain
   Chromium-hiding authority unless deliberately justified.
6. **Requalify on exact product evidence.** Retain the 88 focused Vitest results,
   typecheck, H004 and Work100 as prior evidence, but do not call this lane
   FULLY VALIDATED/P0 CLOSED until the new renderer/Electron restart gate passes.
   Current global main is also not fully green because the separate Browser
   Operational Admission lane still fails the downstream integration-anchor gate.

Exit criteria:
- Clear Parked leaves all active/waiting/human-controlled BrowserTasks intact;
- first cold Chat attach with a recoverable BrowserTask never presents fallback blank;
- H013 exercises the real renderer + preload + IPC + runtime restart path with A/B chats;
- parent/lineage aliases resolve the same canonical BrowserTask;
- only explicit native-view occluders can hide Chromium;
- no new Browser/session/task state owner is introduced;
- exact candidate-head required gates are green or failures are explicitly classified
  as unrelated and do not invalidate the exercised Browser Ownership contracts.


## Browser Operational Admission / Primitive Closure (2026-09-19) — POST-PR #29 CORRECTIVE P0 OPEN

Canonical specification:
[context/BROWSER_OPERATIONAL_ADMISSION_2026-09-18.md](context/BROWSER_OPERATIONAL_ADMISSION_2026-09-18.md).

PR #29 landed substantial Browser/admission infrastructure, but post-merge review of
`main@24997c9af8256ac41001bdee9f827c643d5598e4` found that the milestone was
promoted to "qualified" before its strongest contracts were actually proven. The
landed primitives/effect fixes remain useful; the correction lane below is about
closing false success, false verification, authority minting, mandatory-compilation
closure, browser-readback safety and CI/E2E qualification.

Corrective P0 sequence:
1. **Execute COMPOSE for real or keep it non-terminal.** A `ComposedDecision` must
   execute its capability plan through the deterministic runtime with step/capability
   verification, or return a non-terminal `COMPOSITION_READY/PLANNED` result. A
   plan echo is never operational success and never `COMMITTED`.
2. **ACK is not verification.** `CertifiedDispatcher` must default to
   ACKNOWLEDGED/NEEDS_VERIFICATION when no accepted verifier evidence exists.
   `success=True` alone cannot advance to VERIFIED/COMMITTED unless the formal
   effect/acceptance contract explicitly permits ACK-only evidence.
3. **Close the authority trust boundary.** Model/request payloads may only narrow
   authority. Remove request-authored `trusted_authority` as a trust source and
   remove automatic `EXTERNAL_REVERSIBLE + * + *` authority from bare task/session
   presence. Mutation without a persisted/trusted grant must fail closed or ask human.
4. **Mandatory compilation requires operational closure.** Positive semantic
   homogeneity is necessary but not sufficient. `REQUIRE_COMPILE` additionally
   requires representable deterministic primitive/capability closure, compatible
   authority/policy, verifier/readback and certified dispatch. Otherwise use
   `SUGGEST_COMPILE` while bounded adaptive execution remains legal.
5. **Harden `browser_read_http`.** Native Browser readback is same-origin by
   default; cross-origin requires explicit policy. Reuse canonical URL-safety rules,
   block DNS/IPv6/private/metadata destinations, constrain headers, preserve the full
   payload in artifacts before truncating the inline projection, and fail closed for
   bound Workstation BrowserTasks instead of falling back to process-level
   `requests.request`.
6. **Repair downstream integration anchors.** Update
   `workstation/scripts/apply_core_integration.py` / patch metadata so current
   `browser_type` integration passes the committed-source check on Linux and Windows.
7. **Strengthen semantic-family admission for arbitrary executors.** `terminal`
   must not become mandatory compilation from broad syntactic families such as
   `python:-m` or `bash:-c`; owner-declared semantic operation identity or
   equivalent positive closure is required.
8. **Prove the product path, not mocks only.** Add real Electron/WebContents fixture
   coverage for contenteditable/rich editor paste, delayed SPA hydration,
   session-cookie same-origin readback, persisted verification, drift isolation and
   deterministic fan-out. Keep focused mocks as unit tests, not as the final dogfood
   receipt.
9. **Requalify before closure.** Required Workstation/Windows/CI gates must finish
   green on the exact candidate head. The prior PR #29 runs failed
   `apply_core_integration.py --check` with
   `browser tool route anchor missing for browser_type`; local 599-pass evidence is
   retained but is not sufficient for product qualification.

Hard exit criteria:
- no composition may report success/COMMITTED without executing and verifying its plan;
- no ACK-only result is labeled VERIFIED unless the formal contract explicitly allows it;
- no request/session can synthesize mutation authority;
- no `REQUIRE_COMPILE` without deterministic/verifiable operational closure;
- bound native Browser readback never silently changes into process HTTP fallback;
- no blind retry after uncertain mutation;
- exact-head Workstation + Windows integration gates are green;
- real Electron fixture proves edit -> paste -> save -> persisted readback -> verify ->
  deterministic fan-out with zero intermediate planning.
## Verified Operational Control Plane (2026-09-18) — CP0–CP9 IMPLEMENTED / CONTRACT VALIDATED

Canonical specification:
[context/VERIFIED_OPERATIONAL_CONTROL_PLANE.md](context/VERIFIED_OPERATIONAL_CONTROL_PLANE.md).

PR #26 established the Operational Capability Runtime and PR #27 implemented the
Experience Compiler. Hermes can now execute known capabilities deterministically
and learn reusable capabilities from verified experience. The Verified Operational
Control Plane solves **selection and control**:

> Given an immutable semantic intent, current state, authority/policy and runtime
> events, derive a justified decision to SATISFY / EXECUTE / COMPOSE / WAIT /
> ASK_HUMAN / WAKE_LLM without making the LLM the scheduler.

Core target contracts:

~~~text
OperationIntent
  -> desired state + target + invariants + EffectBudget + AuthorityRef + Acceptance

Capability Router
  -> deterministic executability/typecheck proof

RoutingCertificate / CompositionCertificate
  -> no certificate, no dispatch

AwaitCondition / Trigger Plane
  -> wait durably with zero LLM; event wakes, authoritative state confirms

OpenCondition / AttentionPacket
  -> wake the LLM only for the smallest unresolved semantic decision
~~~

Implemented sequence:

1. **CP0 — typed intent/effect IR + immutable OperationIntent**
   - small versioned predicate/effect AST;
   - stable intent hash and IntentRevision;
   - preserve current WorkIntent behavior;
   - authority references only from trusted ingress/policy.
2. **CP1 — formal Capability contract**
   - backward-compatible typed pre/postconditions, effect footprint,
     target/operation family and authority requirements;
   - authority lattice/JOIN and resource normalization.
3. **CP2 — direct Router + RoutingCertificate**
   - internal capability index;
   - EXACT_EXECUTABLE / POSSIBLE_MATCH / INCOMPATIBLE / NEEDS_REASONING;
   - SATISFIED / EXECUTE / WAIT / ASK_HUMAN / WAKE_LLM;
   - prove goal coverage, effect containment, invariants, authority, policy,
     verifier, freshness and uncertainty closure.
4. **CP3 — bounded deterministic composition**
   - backward chaining over typed contracts;
   - hard search budgets;
   - CompositionCertificate;
   - causal-link/threat/conflicting-effect detection;
   - whole-plan effect/authority/verifier closure.
5. **CP4 — certified dispatch / preflight**
   - only certified dispatchable decision types can reach side-effect dispatch;
   - pin intent/state/capability/router-policy versions;
   - revalidate critical state immediately before mutation;
   - stale certificate reroutes/reconciles.
6. **CP5 — Await/Trigger Plane**
   - persistent AwaitCondition using existing TaskRun/WorkPlan owners;
   - causal/versioned event envelope, dedupe/stale/cycle/fence semantics;
   - restart-safe continuation;
   - deterministic temporal/polling policies;
   - uncorrelated events remain observation-only.
7. **CP6 — minimal reasoning handoff**
   - OpenCondition + AttentionPacket over existing reasoning_handoff;
   - confirmed effects/checkpoints preserved;
   - LLM proposal always returns through Router admission.
8. **CP7 — Skill/catalog routing**
   - semantic capability-family requirements rather than physical IDs by default;
   - internal/lazy catalog; approximate retrieval is proposal-only.
9. **CP8 — evaluation / shadow rollout**
   - Router/Trigger metrics, VOLC/RAR/ONR, failure attribution;
   - adaptive baseline -> shadow Router -> low-risk Router -> mutating Router.
10. **CP9 — integration / product qualification**
    - browser/filesystem/process paths, restart waits, uncertainty reconciliation,
      cross-backend composition, Workstation/Work100/Desktop gates.

Canonical proof properties:

- Router Soundness;
- Goal Non-Expansion;
- Authority Non-Escalation;
- Deterministic Closure;
- Verification Closure;
- Uncertainty Dominance;
- Event wakes; state confirms;
- LLM proposes; Router authorizes;
- **No certificate; no dispatch.**

The Router must remain a bounded deterministic typechecker/proof engine, not
another agent or general planner. Safety/authority/correctness are hard
constraints; optimization is secondary.

## Experience Compiler / Verified Operational Transitions (2026-09-18) — EC0–EC8 IMPLEMENTED / CONTRACT VALIDATED

Canonical specification:
[context/EXPERIENCE_COMPILER.md](context/EXPERIENCE_COMPILER.md).

PR #26 completed the first Progressive Operational Compilation milestone:
semantic operation identity, OperationalCapability Registry/Resolver,
Operational Kernel, direct `work_execute(capability_id, inputs)`, deterministic
composition and exact promoted replay are now implemented foundations.

The next problem is no longer "how do we execute a known capability without an
LLM?". It is:

> **how does Hermes turn real adaptive traces into trustworthy, minimal,
> parameterized OperationalCapabilities without asking an LLM to summarize the
> trace or rediscover the procedure?**

Canonical learned unit:

~~~text
Verified Operational Transition (VOT)
= smallest semantically closed + parameterizable + executable + verifiable
  state transition with positive reuse value
~~~

Target learning stack:

~~~text
adaptive execution
  -> TransitionSamples
  -> semantic state abstraction
  -> transition graph
  -> boundary proposals
  -> cross-trace clustering/alignment
  -> anti-unification + invariants
  -> conservative preconditions/effects/branches
  -> dependency / Operational Slice
  -> observational causal support
  -> safe replay / ablation where admissible
  -> counterexample refinement
  -> OperationalCapability Candidate
  -> trust/risk/causal promotion admission
  -> exact resolver / work_execute
~~~

Implemented sequence (evidence and remaining qualification: context/TESTING.md):

1. **EC0 — transition identity at capture**
   - normalize `procedure_trace` into a first-class TransitionSample contract;
   - fix browser fingerprinting so derived semantic anchors participate in
     operation identity rather than ref-only calls falling back to structural shape;
   - normalize emitted/replayable anchor types (`name` mismatch included).
2. **EC1 — semantic state + provenance**
   - bounded state predicates and semantic deltas;
   - evidence strength, Task/Run/operation lineage, trust class and taint.
3. **EC2 — corpus, segmentation and pattern discovery**
   - Experience Corpus projection over existing ArtifactStore/ExecutionJournal;
   - effect/commit/verification/changepoint/backend boundaries;
   - cross-trace alignment; core vs conditional vs optional vs anomalous.
4. **EC3 — parameterization / action-model inference**
   - anti-unify instance values into typed parameters;
   - infer supported parameter relations/invariants;
   - conservative preconditions/effects and state-conditioned branches;
   - failures/drift are negative examples.
5. **EC4 — dependency and causal support**
   - compute Operational Slices from data/control/effect dependency graphs;
   - separate recurrence/generalization from causal confidence;
   - assign explicit C0-C5 causal grades.
6. **EC5 — safe replay / ablation / counterexamples**
   - controlled replay and delta reduction only in safe/reversible environments;
   - no destructive production experimentation to improve a capability;
   - counterexamples refine assumptions into a new immutable candidate version.
7. **EC6 — promotion hardening / stable library view**
   - learned mutation promotion cannot be granted by raw validation count alone;
   - provenance/taint, E0-E3 evidence, C0-C5 causal grade, risk, diversity and
     utility participate in admission;
   - TaskRun uses a stable capability-version view;
   - run-local ephemeral compiled segment != globally promoted capability.
8. **EC7 — integration / registry economics**
   - emit candidates into the existing OperationalCapabilityRegistry;
   - preserve exact zero-LLM replay;
   - deduplicate/prune with utility/MDL-style value;
   - keep retrieval broad but execution admission exact.
9. **EC8 — cross-backend proof**
   - browser + filesystem lifecycle parity;
   - process/local case;
   - one cross-backend learned composite;
   - one atomic learned capability reused by two larger flows.

**Causal rule:** passive trace recurrence can propose/generalize a candidate, but
cannot by itself prove step necessity or grant high causal confidence.
Observational mining and interventional validation are separate phases.

**Trust rule:** Experience -> persistent Capability is a trust boundary. Repeated
untrusted page prose never becomes authority merely because the agent followed it.

**Promotion rule:** capture broadly, promote narrowly. The generic
`OperationalCapabilityRegistry.record_validation(..., auto_promote_threshold=2)`
must not be the complete promotion authority for experience-learned mutations.

**Optimization target:** minimize new reasoning required per verified outcome over
the lifetime of the system, while preserving the Canonical Execution Reliability
Gate.

## Upstream Reliability Hardening Intake (2026-09-18) — P0 IMPLEMENTED & VALIDATED; P1 PLANNED

Canonical implementation plan:
[context/UPSTREAM_RELIABILITY_HARDENING_2026-09-18.md](context/UPSTREAM_RELIABILITY_HARDENING_2026-09-18.md).

The 2026-09-18 upstream sweep found several failure modes that map directly onto
the Workstation reliability boundary. All confirmed P0 gaps have been implemented
and hardened on branch `fix/workstation-upstream-reliability-p0` without introducing
parallel state engines or breaking existing Workstation owners.

Completed P0 implementation order:

1. **P0.0 — revalidate/extend native Browser truth (#114964-derived): [DONE]**
   Reused existing H004 probe (`probes/h004-native-browser-task-smoke.mjs`) and
   extended it with deterministic discriminators: live WebContents id, continuous
   timer advance, input persistence, scroll persistence, and loopback controller
   action execution (`browser_snapshot`, `electron-chromium`). Explicit failure
   if external fallback occurs.
2. **P0.1 — recovery/resync correctness (#115068 + #115085): [DONE]**
   Ported live-tail journal selection via `findLastIndex` with duplicate interim
   row protection in `inflight-turn-journal.ts` (39 vitest tests). Preserved
   unacknowledged optimistic user messages during background resync in
   `use-background-sync.ts` and `wiring.tsx` (17 vitest tests).
3. **P0.2 — one canonical session writer (#111493): [DONE]**
   Enforced single-writer exclusivity per `session_id` in `active_sessions.py`,
   fenced transfers against foreign live writers, implemented `mode="observer"`
   read-only resume in `cli.py`, and failed closed on registry corruption.
   (7 tests in `test_cli_resume_read_only_owner.py`).
4. **P0.3 — Kanban truth/provenance (#114785 + #114793 + #114904): [DONE]**
   Validated session provenance against SessionDB (`state.db`) and request-scoped
   `HERMES_SESSION_ID` ContextVar; made heartbeat require both claim and worker
   writes to persist; fenced delegated child tasks; added durable worker-exit
   trailers (`HERMES_WORKER_EXIT_TRAILER_V1`) for topology-independent exit
   classification in `kanban_db.py` / `cli.py`.
   (7 tests in `test_kanban_provenance_and_exit_evidence.py`).
5. **P0.4 — bounded browser fallback recovery (#114897): [DONE]**
   Capped post-attach CDP reconnect attempts at 5 in `tools/browser_supervisor.py`,
   evicted exhausted supervisor from registry, reset failure budget on successful
   attach, and redacted credentials in warning logs.
   (3 tests in `test_browser_supervisor_reconnect_cap.py`).
6. **P1 next steps (after P0 PR review):**
   Design one Durable Delivery Rail from the common invariants in #115009/#115010/#114780
   and delegation-completion work; then benchmark snapshot quality using #115056.
   Do not create parallel queues or a second browser snapshot authority.

Explicit dispositions:

- **#114964:** production invariant is already implemented in BrowserTask; probe
  re-validated with extended real discriminators.
- **#114986 phantom turn lease:** no direct port now because this downstream
  `gateway.ts` does not contain the upstream `turnLeases` mechanism. Keep on
  rebase watchlist.
- **#115056:** native Work inventory is already one principal
  `webContents.executeJavaScript(...)` observation; P1 will benchmark and import
  hit-test/freshness ideas only.
- **computer-use provider seam / desktop bridge:** defer until native OS-control
  is an active milestone.
- **browser vault / Bot Screen / workflow-record:** P2; security, platform and
  RecipeStore boundaries take precedence.


## Progressive Operational Compilation & Operational Capability Runtime (2026-09-18) — FULLY IMPLEMENTED & VALIDATED

Canonical implementation document:
[context/PROGRESSIVE_OPERATIONAL_COMPILATION.md](context/PROGRESSIVE_OPERATIONAL_COMPILATION.md).
Settled architectural decision:
[D-018 in context/DECISIONS.md](context/DECISIONS.md).
Engineering journal record:
[H-067 in context/engineering-journal/CURRENT.md](context/engineering-journal/CURRENT.md).

The complete architecture for **Progressive Operational Compilation / Operational Capability Runtime** has been fully implemented, resolving AEPC-E002 and establishing a deterministic runtime execution substrate that eliminates unnecessary model round-trips without mutating past context or breaking existing stores.

Completed implementation summary:

1. **Semantic Target Family & Homogeneity Hardening (AEPC-E002 Resolved):**
   - Implemented `semantic_target_family()` and `semantic_operation_fingerprint()` in `workstation/execution_policy.py`.
   - Structural repetition without positive semantic homogeneity evidence never triggers `REQUIRE_COMPILE`; it only yields `SUGGEST_COMPILE`.
   - Distinct ephemeral refs (`@e1`, `@e37`, `@e92`) are no longer conflated with homogeneous fan-out.
   - Non-browser domain mutations retain strict compile requirements on the 3rd distinct equivalent mutation.
   - `CompilationCandidate` tracks `executed_occurrences` vs. `verified_successes` separately (`executed_unverified` never counts as verified success).

2. **Native Electron Target Metadata & Structured Elements:**
   - Updated `apps/desktop/electron/workstation-browser-runtime.ts` inventory and point scripts to extract `testid`, `name`, `role`, `tag`, and `label`.
   - Snapshot entries and action responses (`browser_click`, `browser_type`) now return structured element targets and semantic effects.

3. **Operational Capabilities Substrate (`workstation/operational_capabilities.py`):**
   - Implemented `OperationalCapability`, `CapabilityDependency`, `CapabilityLifecycle` (`DISCOVERED`, `VALIDATED`, `PROMOTED`, `RETIRED`).
   - `OperationalCapabilityRegistry` backed by existing `ArtifactStore` with cross-platform file locking (`fcntl`/`msvcrt`).
   - `CapabilityResolver` with cycle detection, depth limits, and topological sorting.
   - Automatic routine compilation via `learn_operational_capability()`.

4. **Deterministic Operational Kernel (`workstation/operational_kernel.py`):**
   - Zero-LLM execution of verified deterministic steps across filesystem and browser primitives.
   - Condition verification, variable interpolation (`$inputs`, `$deps`, `$prev`), and automatic drift detection with fail-closed quarantine.

5. **Direct & Automatic Reuse in `work_execute`:**
   - Added `capability_id`, `capability_version`, `capability_inputs` to `work_execute` tool schema.
   - Transparent reuse: when matching promoted capabilities exist for repetitive operations, `TaskCompiler` reuses them automatically with zero LLM calls.

6. **Validation & Gates:**
   - 100% passing tests across `workstation/tests/test_operational_capabilities.py` (12 tests) and `workstation/tests/test_execution_policy.py` (11 tests).
   - Full workstation suite: 510 passed, 2 skipped, 0 failed.
   - Work100 benchmark: 30 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 gaps.
   - Vitest desktop runtime tests: 45 passed (100% green); TypeScript typecheck passes with 0 errors.


## Adaptive Execution & Progressive Compilation Gate (2026-09-18) — IMPLEMENTED; SEMANTIC-HOMOGENEITY HARDENING CLOSED WITH OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY RUNTIME

Remote implementation `9e7292ab7825e5ce1ea294490eec57ba1f286069`
(documentation/evidence `5e1b22527fd40d732ee4fa7a1035e6366953f6b7`; local
pre-publish implementation SHA `365794e29d66cd63a6134c5c67ecc1ef603d70a6`)
correctly removes the turn-wide mutation latch, normalizes effects/routes,
adds bounded adaptive discovery, compact handoff/resume and verified reuse.
Final recorded Python gate: 570 passed / 2 skipped; Work100: 30 PASS / 0 FAIL /
0 gaps; Desktop owner contracts: 36 passed.

AEPC-E002 reopened one narrow contract boundary: structural call similarity is
not sufficient proof of homogeneous fan-out. Current built-in browser mutations
such as `browser_type`, `browser_click` and `browser_press` do not declare a
concrete mutation target/target family, so three semantically different stateful
UI actions can still converge on the same structural signature and trigger
`REQUIRE_COMPILE`. KI-011 therefore has its original global-latch cause fixed,
but long stateful-browser closure remains open until semantic homogeneity is
proven before mandatory compilation. Authenticated native/packaged Electron
smoke remains a separate final product gate. Simulated provider-call reductions
do not establish paid-provider savings.

Real native-browser dogfood exposed an architectural overreach in the durable
compiler boundary: the baseline mechanism introduced to keep repetitive mechanical work
out of the LLM loop could turn a repeatability hint into a broad mutation
gate and block legitimate stateful/adaptive work before a deterministic procedure
has been discovered.

Canonical specification:
[context/ADAPTIVE_EXECUTION_COMPILATION.md](context/ADAPTIVE_EXECUTION_COMPILATION.md).

This correction preserves the Canonical Execution Reliability Gate and its
canary, uncertainty, fencing, acceptance, reconciliation and evidence invariants.
It changes **when compilation is mandatory**.

Target execution ladder:

~~~text
novel/drifted work
  -> ADAPTIVE reasoning + bounded tools
  -> stable segment captured
  -> COMPILED segment/work
  -> validated Procedure/Recipe
  -> PROMOTED ROUTINE
  -> drift => compact NEEDS_REASONING handoff
  -> adapt only the unresolved segment
~~~

Implemented sequence (retained as the acceptance checklist):

1. replace the session/turn-wide _work_batch_candidate latch with an
   operation-scoped compilation candidate / policy decision;
2. add ALLOW_ADAPTIVE | SUGGEST_COMPILE | REQUIRE_COMPILE | REQUIRE_HUMAN;
3. normalize browser tool constraints to native_browser and make tools.effects
   the single effect taxonomy;
4. allow bounded stateful native-browser interaction during discovery while
   retaining BrowserTask/TaskRun leases, approvals and effect uncertainty;
5. add compact NEEDS_REASONING escape/resume semantics to deterministic work;
6. capture successful adaptive traces into existing Recipe/ProceduralMemory
   owners and automatically reuse verified procedures;
7. measure LLM calls/tokens/tool calls per verified outcome plus Guardrail
   Obstruction Rate;
8. add regressions proving both sides: native-browser adaptive progress works and
   homogeneous fan-out still cannot bypass TaskCompiler/canary.

### AEPC-E002 follow-up — semantic homogeneity before mandatory compilation

Required hardening, in order:

1. separate **structural similarity** from **semantic homogeneity** in
   `CompilationCandidate` / `execution_policy.py`;
2. require a stable owner-declared or safely derived operation family before
   `REQUIRE_COMPILE`: operation + canonical route/provider + concrete
   target-family/contract identity. Shape-only browser calls are not enough;
3. keep long stateful native-browser sequences adaptive when successive
   click/type/press actions target different semantic UI goals, while preserving
   TaskRun/BrowserTask fencing, approval, uncertainty and no-progress limits;
4. retain mandatory TaskCompiler/canary admission for real homogeneous fan-out;
5. add paired regressions: a long stateful browser flow with 3+ same-tool
   mutations remains adaptive, while three true same-family mutations still
   transition to `REQUIRE_COMPILE`;
6. rename or redefine `CompilationCandidate.successful_occurrences` so
   `executed_unverified` is never represented as verified success;
7. reconcile all canonical docs to the remote SHAs above and preserve the
   original local SHA only as pre-publish history.

**Exit criteria:** no threshold increase, browser-name exemption or global bypass.
The runtime must be able to explain *why* operations are one compilable family;
absence of that proof keeps execution bounded/adaptive rather than manufacturing
homogeneity.

**Sequencing:** the global-latch correction is implemented, but AEPC-E002 must
close before KI-011 is called fully resolved. Retain the native qualification
gate before claiming product-level closure. Do not weaken fan-out safety to fix
usability, and do not require determinism as a precondition for discovering a
safe deterministic path.

## Canonical Execution Reliability Gate (2026-09-17) — IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED

**Milestone implemented and verified on branch `antigravity/canonical-execution-reliability-gate`.**
The causal reliability gate establishes full end-to-end lineage, run fencing, terminal tree reconciliation, streaming journal hash chaining, and human takeover fencing, proven by 35 canonical work loop tests, 446 workstation tests, and clean `work100.py --run` execution.

Canonical specification and exit criteria:
[`context/CANONICAL_EXECUTION_RELIABILITY_GATE.md`](context/CANONICAL_EXECUTION_RELIABILITY_GATE.md).

The gate converts the Workstation from a broad set of implemented capabilities into
a causally trustworthy operational system. The target loop is:

```text
intent
  -> canonical Task
  -> canonical TaskRun
  -> WorkPlan / WorkItems
  -> Browser / Worker / Host operations
  -> evidence
  -> acceptance / verification
  -> canonical commit
  -> journal / projections
  -> result
  -> learning / routine
```

The work is dependency ordered:

1. **P0 — causal execution invariants**
   - canonical Task -> TaskRun -> WorkPlan/WorkItem lineage;
   - separate durable `execution_key` from canonical Task identity;
   - propagate `run_id` through Workstation events/evidence/resources/reports;
   - complete agent-owned tasks with canonical `expected_run_id` fencing;
   - commit canonical completion before terminal journal/UI/Hybrid projections;
   - reconcile terminal parents with live descendants;
   - give mutable effects durable `operation_id` + uncertainty/reconciliation semantics;
   - enforce typed Intent Authority at every work-creation boundary.
2. **P1 — reliability, fencing and recovery**
   - Run-scoped mutation fencing for Browser/Worker/Host resources;
   - startup/periodic reconciliation over existing Supervisor/Recovery/Evidence owners;
   - exactly-once Agent Task -> Human Card result/evidence projection;
   - systemic-failure cohort/circuit-breaker coverage beyond the TaskCompiler canary;
   - cron health/config/model migration semantics.
3. **P2 — efficiency and auditability**
   - evidence provenance tied to Task/Run/operation/acceptance criterion;
   - Runtime State Resolver so the LLM stops reconstructing deterministic state;
   - reference-first artifact/tool outputs and context/FTS canonicalization;
   - bounded no-progress/polling behavior;
   - long-run journal scalability/integrity benchmark.
4. **P3 — evaluation, learning and UX**
   - corpus-derived Hermes Work 100 seed suite;
   - AVCR plus false-completion/zombie/recovery/uncertainty/efficiency metrics;
   - measured Experience -> Candidate -> Validate -> Promote -> Routine -> Drift;
   - Task Cockpit/Control Center only after state truth is proven.

### Immediate invariants

```text
Task.status = terminal
  must be attributable to the authoritative TaskRun or an explicit human override

parent.status = terminal
  => no descendant remains externally LIVE after the reconciliation barrier

mutable operation dispatched + acknowledgement lost
  => UNCERTAIN / RECONCILING, never blind retry

journal says completed
  => canonical completion already committed successfully

system/tool/scheduler/recovery event
  != human CREATE_WORK unless an explicit authority transition permits it
```

### Reuse, do not rebuild

This gate deliberately reuses what current `main` already has: canonical Kanban
`task_runs/current_run_id`, `expected_run_id` CAS support, BrowserTask,
TaskCompiler canary/admission, dispatch checkpoints, idempotency contracts,
recipe staleness/quarantine, Execution Journal, EvidenceState, WorkerRegistry,
Recovery Plane, human-control leases, Hybrid delegation and the existing artifact
reference plane. The work is integration/hardening, not a second orchestration or
state system.

### Global sequencing override

Any later wording in this historical roadmap that says a V1/V1.1/V2/V3/V3.5/V4
item is “active next”, “must happen next”, or is otherwise next in sequence is
**deferred by this gate**. Completed/implemented labels below remain implementation
history; they do not imply product-level causal reliability until this gate passes.

## Foundation — on current `main`

- `workstation/` architecture, contracts, policies and upstream tracking.
- first-class `/browser` route in Hermes Desktop.
- internal Electron Chromium Browser runtime with dedicated persistent profile.
- multiple tabs, navigation, attach/detach, background survival and cache-only maintenance.
- pause/resume, focus, take/release control primitives.
- loopback-only bearer-authenticated Browser controller in Hermes Desktop.
- `browser_*` integration that prefers internal Chromium and fails closed after task binding.
- Kanban Desktop enabled by default in this downstream distribution.
- stable/edge channel metadata.
- CI skeleton, lock/license validation and Windows Browser E2E workflow.
- eval matrix prepared for internal/agent-browser/browser-exec.
- Desktop Browser schema capability is session-scoped and protected from process-global cache/env leakage.
- first-class BrowserTask lifecycle promoted by PR #9: `create` / `show` / `hide` / `park` / explicit `destroy`, crash recovery, safe logical persistence and restart restoration.
- `taskTabs` + `BrowserEntry.ownerTaskId` remain the authoritative live Chromium task→page ownership primitives; no second page store was introduced.
- one `taskId` is idempotently bound to at most one live task page in a Desktop process.
- hide/park/show preserve the same live page and current URL while the process remains alive.
- restart restores safe BrowserTask metadata as parked and lazily recreates exactly one page under the same logical task when needed.
- composite BrowserSessionState now persists ordinary/task logical tabs, order,
  active selection, sanitized restorable metadata and BrowserTask linkage through
  one atomic state authority.
- clean and abrupt two-process restart, profile/state separation and failed-write
  convergence are validated by H010 on the accepted PR #11 head.

## Implementation 4 — promoted

PR #9 (`feat(workstation): formalize BrowserTask lifecycle`) was promoted to `main` in merge commit `fada723f43613e5e0f061cab24445573ac298998` from accepted head `75d10d35d4757496390debf8e4b4f9efb44c5432`.

Acceptance evidence:

- focused BrowserTask lifecycle/runtime tests passed;
- real Windows/Electron H-004 smoke validated same-page hide/park re-exposure, explicit destroy, two-process logical restart recovery, exactly-one-page ownership and structural secret isolation;
- controlled Windows baseline comparison returned `WINDOWS_BASELINE_COMPARISON=PASS_WITH_KI-006_RED` and found no Implementation 4 regression class;
- exact-final-head Workstation CI and Docker gates passed; the broad Windows aggregator remained red only for the known KI-006 baseline debt.

The following work remains intentionally outside Implementation 4.

## Delivery strategy — reliability gate before further feature hardening

From 2026-09-17 the roadmap has three complementary delivery modes:

1. **Canonical Execution Reliability Gate** — immediate cross-domain invariant hardening; this blocks further feature-expansion sequencing until its exit criteria pass.
2. **Canonical milestone hardening** — each numbered milestone remains responsible for its rigorous architecture, ownership model, security boundary, recovery semantics, migrations, regression coverage and native evidence.
3. **Integrated MVP dogfood** — the historical V1 #1.5 vertical slice remains useful product history and a post-gate feature-integration reference.

The MVP track is **not** permission to create throwaway architecture. Every MVP slice must:

- reuse the canonical Hermes/Workstation owner for state and control;
- avoid second SessionDB/Kanban/Memory/browser stores or duplicate live pages;
- preserve BrowserTask one-live-page and bound-task fail-closed invariants;
- prefer a narrow working path over a broad fake/stub path;
- keep experimental V1.1/V2 slices opt-in when they are not yet suitable for the default path;
- leave the original milestone open for later robustness work rather than marking it complete merely because its MVP exists;
- include at least one behavior contract or dogfood scenario strong enough to prove that the slice is actually usable.

The intended cadence is now:

```text
V1 #1 BrowserSessionState — rigorous completion
        ↓
pre-1.5 Mainline Consolidation Gate — PASS
        ↓
Canonical Execution Reliability Gate — ACTIVE
        ↓
V1 #1.5 / remaining feature-hardening roadmap resumes
        ↓
continuous real usage / dogfooding + Hermes Work 100
        ↓
V1 #2, #3, #4... / V1.1 / V2 / V3+ hardening as still applicable
```

## V1 #1 — BrowserSessionState — promoted

PR #11 accepted `d5be442021ea0c744351622317eef5212219786d` and was
promoted as merge `e0a99ef3aba6e6d2b65c30cf3c908ee1d49c4d29`.

The milestone delivered the composite safe structural state, atomic convergence,
ordinary/task tab order and active selection, safe URL/title recovery boundaries,
BrowserTask coexistence, legacy migration and explicit clean/abrupt restart
semantics. H010 emitted `H010_CLASSIFICATION=VALIDATED` on the exact accepted
Windows/Electron head.

Controller/session/run/Kanban linkage beyond the identifiers already present in
BrowserTask is now part of the immediate Canonical Execution Reliability Gate where
it affects causal TaskRun identity. This does not reopen the completed structural
BrowserSessionState owner.

## Mainline Consolidation Gate

The extraordinary gate between V1 #1/PR #12 and the historical V1 #1.5 sequence is
**PASS**. Its audit base, PR/branch disposition ledger, checklist and recurring
review procedure are canonical in
`context/MAINLINE_CONSOLIDATION.md`.

Its branch/history result remains valid. The 2026-09-17 reliability gate is a new
post-consolidation priority discovered from runtime/state evidence; it does not
invalidate the historical consolidation result.

## Deferred roadmap — resumes after Canonical Execution Reliability Gate

### 1.5. Integrated Dogfood MVP — whole-roadmap vertical slice

**Sequence:** V1 #1 and the pre-1.5 Mainline Consolidation Gate are complete.
This remains the next historical feature-integration milestone **after** the
Canonical Execution Reliability Gate closes. It no longer outranks the reliability
gate.

**Purpose:** make the Hermes Workstation useful as an integrated daily-driver alpha as early as possible. Instead of waiting for every later subsystem to become architecturally exhaustive, implement the smallest real version of every currently planned capability on top of the correct owners. Real dogfood then supplies evidence for the later hardening milestones.

The full V1 #1 implementation is the state foundation for this milestone; its MVP is therefore considered satisfied by the stronger completed BrowserSessionState rather than reimplemented separately.

#### MVP map for every roadmap milestone

| **V1 #1 — BrowserSessionState**                               | Satisfied by the completed milestone: ordinary logical tabs/order/active state, safe restorable metadata, BrowserTask relation and explicit restart/recovery projection.                                                       | Further defects discovered by dogfood remain #1 follow-up/hardening, not a parallel state model.                                 |
| **V1 #2 — Chat Browser View + Browser Hub**                   | A contextual Chat surface can expose/inspect a BrowserTask and a global Hub can list/open the same BrowserTasks. Both resolve the same runtime/task identity.                                                                  | Rich layouts, polished navigation, grouping UX, thumbnails, accessibility and exhaustive UI behavior.                            |
| **V1 #3 — single-host ownership / viewport transfer**         | One explicit/manual transfer path moves the same live `WebContentsView` between the MVP Chat surface and Hub with no duplicate navigation/page.                                                                                | Full geometry state machine, resize/maximize/restore/sidebar/pane matrix, race handling and exhaustive native composition tests. |
| **V1 #4 — Preview compatibility adapter**                     | For a Workstation-bound browser task, the basic Preview path reuses/adapts to the same BrowserTask/runtime or refuses to create a duplicate lane.                                                                              | Complete compatibility/parity for every Preview action and transition.                                                           |
| **V1 #5 — persistent controller/session/run/Kanban bindings** | Persist the minimum identity set required by dogfood (`taskId`, Hermes `session_id`, available run/card identifiers) through existing BrowserSessionState references, with one-time binding and mismatch fail-closed behavior. | Full migration matrix, lineage semantics, rotation/recovery edge cases and richer identity policies.                             |
| **V1 #6 — automatic Kanban promotion**                        | A clearly multistep Workstation request can automatically create/bind one Hermes Kanban parent card and its BrowserTask through the existing Kanban path.                                                                      | Sophisticated planning/classification, decomposition policy, prioritization and generalized orchestration.                       |
| **V1 #7 — follow-up discovery / parent dependency**           | A running task can emit one child/follow-up card carrying `parent_task_id`, `discovered_by`, `reason`, `evidence` and `origin_session_id`, with a minimal parent-blocked/child-complete relationship.                          | General dependency graphs, scheduler semantics, fan-out/fan-in and advanced planning.                                            |
| **V1 #8 — Execution Journal**                                 | Persist a minimal append-only execution/evidence journal referenced by the canonical task/card, with timestamp, action/tool, result/status and selective screenshot evidence only at explicit key events.                      | Rich replay, retention, compaction, cost/event taxonomy, advanced evidence viewer and governance.                                |
| **V1 #9 — completion reports**                                | On completion, write a concise summary plus structured task/session/card/evidence metadata through `kanban_complete(metadata=...)`.                                                                                            | Rich report templates, analytics, cross-run synthesis and advanced reporting UX.                                                 |
| **V1 #10 — Browser live task rail**                           | Desktop shows a simple task rail grouped into `active`, `waiting-for-human`, `background` and `recent`, backed by canonical BrowserTask/Kanban state.                                                                          | Advanced filtering, prioritization, thumbnails, Dashboard/mobile parity and richer task operations.                              |

| **V1 #12 — popup/SSO + download/upload UX**                   | Support one common same-profile popup/SSO flow plus basic file upload selection and download completion/location visibility.                                                                                                   | Broad popup policies, complex SSO/multi-window flows, download manager, chooser edge cases and polished UX.                      |
| **V1 #13 — recovery E2E**                                     | One real golden recovery scenario proves controller/browser interruption → pause → reconnect/rebind → identity/profile verification → resume.                                                                                  | Chaos matrix, multiple simultaneous failures, backoff policies, long-running soak and exhaustive recovery combinations.          |
| **V1 #14 — Windows clean-install + native E2E**               | One supported Windows toolchain proves fresh checkout → one-click install/doctor/start → Desktop opens → one real BrowserTask/host-composition smoke.                                                                          | Wider Windows/toolchain matrix, packaging/updater paths and exhaustive clean-machine/native composition coverage.                |
| **V1.1 — Tailscale**                                          | Opt-in detection of an already-installed/authenticated Tailscale environment and presentation/use of the official authenticated Dashboard route over the detected Tailnet address.                                             | Installation/account management, richer lifecycle, policy and remote diagnostics.                                                |
| **V1.1 — external Hermes Browser Extension compatibility**    | Optional experimental routing of one **unbound** task through the official extension lane for a basic navigate/read path; bound internal tasks remain fail-closed.                                                             | Feature parity, reconnect/lease depth, broader routing policy and compatibility matrix.                                          |
| **V1.1 — richer cache/resource maintenance**                  | One safe, scoped maintenance action for Workstation browser cache/site data plus basic diagnostics; never clear personal Chrome/Edge data.                                                                                     | Policy engine, granular resource management, scheduling, storage visualization and automatic maintenance.                        |
| **V1.1 — download/upload UX**                                 | Extend the V1 #12 MVP with a minimal downloads list/status and a reliable explicit upload chooser path.                                                                                                                        | Rich file management, retries, queueing, previews and cross-device UX.                                                           |
| **V1.1 — richer multi-task scheduling/ownership**             | Run at least two BrowserTasks with a simple queue/background model, one visible native host at a time and explicit task ownership; simple FIFO/manual selection is sufficient.                                                 | Priorities, fairness, leases, preemption, resource budgets and sophisticated scheduling.                                         |

| **V2 — provenance-aware compact perception**                  | Produce one compact page representation from the current browser state with stable provenance references sufficient for an agent to inspect and perform a basic action.                                                        | Adaptive perception, multimodal fusion, aggressive token optimization, cross-page provenance and full Lattice-inspired engine.   |
| **V2 — drift diagnosis / governed adaptation**                | Detect one class of procedure/selector mismatch, classify it as drift, stop unsafe continuation and trigger re-exploration or human/agent replanning with evidence.                                                            | Automated repair policies, confidence thresholds, regression-vs-drift inference, governance and long-term adaptation.            |
| **V2 — Lightpanda runtime**                                   | Experimental opt-in runtime adapter for safe **unbound, stateless/read-oriented** web tasks; no silent migration of a bound/authenticated Electron BrowserTask.                                                                | Benchmark-driven routing, broader web compatibility, stateful semantics, scheduling and production runtime support.              |

#### Integrated dogfood golden path

The 1.5 milestone is considered useful only when a real user can exercise an end-to-end path resembling:

```text
double-click one launcher
  → install/validate/doctor/start automatically
  → Hermes Desktop opens
  → user asks for a clearly multistep web task
  → Hermes creates/binds canonical Kanban + BrowserTask identities
  → internal Chromium performs visible work
  → user can inspect the task from Chat and Browser Hub MVP surfaces
  → the same live page can be manually transferred between hosts
  → Preview does not create an independent duplicate for the bound task
  → task rail shows current state
  → a discovered child task can be recorded
  → journal/evidence is persisted
  → completion writes structured Kanban metadata/report
  → restart/recovery preserves the logical task/profile boundary
```

The LAN, Tailscale, external-extension, memory/perception/drift and Lightpanda MVP slices may remain explicitly experimental/opt-in, but they must be executable real paths rather than documentation-only placeholders.

#### Exit criteria for 1.5

- every row above has a real implementation at its stated MVP boundary or is blocked by a documented non-negotiable dependency discovered after V1 #1;
- no MVP introduces a competing SessionDB, Kanban, Memory, browser page store or control plane;
- one-click Windows dogfood startup exists and is documented;
- the integrated golden path has executable evidence on Windows/Electron;
- known limitations are recorded without reclassifying original milestones as complete;
- after 1.5, development resumes at **V1 #2** and revisits the original roadmap milestone-by-milestone for architectural hardening.

2. Build the contextual Chat Browser View and global Browser Hub as two views of the same BrowserTask/runtime.
3. Implement a single-host ownership/viewport contract for moving one live `WebContentsView` between Chat and Browser Hub; validate resize/maximize/restore/pane changes without overlap.
4. Replace the independent Workstation-mode Preview browsing lane with a compatibility adapter over the same BrowserTask/runtime where appropriate.
5. Persist controller/session/run/Kanban identity bindings across process restarts without introducing a second SessionDB/Kanban store.
6. Promote multistep requests into Kanban automatically.
7. Add follow-up task discovery metadata and parent dependency policy.
8. Add Workstation Execution Journal persistence and selective screenshots.
9. Generate browser task completion reports into `kanban_complete(metadata=...)` — **Completed** (`workstation/kanban.py`).
10. Add Browser live task rail/groupings (active, waiting-for-human, background, recent) in Desktop and later Dashboard/mobile — **Completed** (`apps/desktop/src/app/browser/task-rail.tsx`).
11. Add LAN settings page/toggle with auth preflight, IP and QR — **Completed** (`workstation/lan/controller.py`).
12. Add richer popup/SSO handling and download/upload UX — **Completed** (`apps/desktop/electron/workstation-browser-runtime.ts`).
13. Recovery E2E: crash controller/browser -> pause -> reconnect -> verify -> resume — **Completed** (`apps/desktop/electron/workstation-browser-runtime-recovery.test.ts`).
14. Windows clean-install + native BrowserTask/host-composition E2E — **Completed** (`START-HERMES-WORKSTATION.bat`, `install.ps1`, `doctor.ps1`).

## V1.1 — Completed & Hardened
 
- Tailscale integration (`workstation/lan/controller.py` - `detect_tailscale`).
- optional external Hermes Browser Extension compatibility mode (`workstation/routing.py`).
- richer cache/resource maintenance (`apps/desktop/electron/workstation-browser-runtime.ts` - `cleanupCache`).
- download/upload UX (`apps/desktop/electron/workstation-browser-runtime.ts` - `downloads` tracking and interactive Hub drawer).
- richer multi-task scheduling/ownership policies on top of the one-task/one-live-page invariant (`workstation/scheduler.py` - `MultiTaskScheduler`), hardened with lease timeouts, heartbeats, and orphan task reaping (H-106).
 
## V2 — Completed & Hardened
 
- procedural web memory (`discover -> run -> explore -> learn`) (`workstation/memory.py` - `ProceduralMemory`), hardened with multi-facet fallback anchors (testid -> role -> text -> selector) and concurrent disk merge (H-101).
- provenance-aware compact perception engine inspired by Lattice (`workstation/perception.py` - `PerceptionEngine`), hardened with hidden/invisible node filtering (H-102) and tiered smart budgeting that guarantees CTA and form preservation under token limits (H-103).
- drift diagnosis and governed adaptation (`workstation/drift.py` - `DriftGovernor`), hardened with blocking cookie/modal overlay detection (`DISMISS_OVERLAY`) (H-104) and strict financial/destructive action boundaries in `workstation/safety.py`.
- Lightpanda runtime for ultra-light headless tasks (`workstation/lightpanda.py` & `workstation/routing.py` - `LightpandaAdapter`), hardened with transparent gzip/deflate decompression and fail-closed auth redirect detection (H-105).
- Windows filesystem atomic resilience: eliminated `EPERM` / `EBUSY` in `BrowserSessionStateFilePersistence` via `copyFileSync` fallback (H-107).

## V2.1 — Native Chrome Web Store Extensions Support — Partial / Agentic Install Slice Implemented

- **Chrome Web Store Extension Downloader & Unpacker** — **Completed** (`workstation/extensions.py` - `ChromeExtensionManager`):
  - Mecanismo para baixar pacotes `.crx` diretamente da Chrome Web Store a partir do ID da extensão ou URL pública (via endpoint oficial de atualização do Chromium: `clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx`).
  - Descompactação segura com remoção de cabeçalho binário `Cr24` para diretório dedicado no perfil da Workstation (`~/.hermes/workstation/extensions/<extension_id>/`).
- **Native Electron Runtime Loading** — **Completed** (`apps/desktop/electron/workstation-browser-runtime.ts` - `loadInstalledExtensions`):
  - Integração no `WorkstationBrowserRuntime` via `this.browserSession.loadExtension(extensionPath, { allowFileAccess: true })`.
  - Persistência e restauração automática das extensões instaladas durante a inicialização da sessão do Chromium.
- **Agent Tooling & Governed Extension Interaction** — **Implemented vertical slice** (`tools/workstation_extensions.py`, `workstation/policy.py`, `apps/desktop/electron/workstation-browser-runtime.ts`):
  - Ferramentas de sessão Desktop para instalar, listar, remover e abrir opções; elas não aparecem em CLI/gateway sem superfície Desktop.
  - A instalação baixa para memória, inspeciona permissões do `manifest.json`, classifica risco e consulta `ScopedPolicyEngine`; permissões médias/altas e remoção exigem o approval gate canônico.
  - Sucesso de instalação exige `install -> Electron load -> runtime verification`; falha de load remove o artefato local em vez de declarar a capability pronta.
  - Todas as transições são registradas no `ExecutionJournal` canônico.
- **Hardening remaining**:
  - Não existe ainda um catálogo/busca semântica da Chrome Web Store: o agente recebe ID ou URL pública, em vez de selecionar extensões a partir de resultados de marketplace.
  - Não há UI dedicada de gerenciamento de extensões no Desktop; a superfície atual é agent/tool + BrowserTask options page.
  - Atualização in-place agora usa staging, journal de promoção e last-known-good: falha de replace, load, verificação ou restart restaura a versão anterior. A transação é coberta por `workstation/tests/test_extensions.py`.

## Hybrid Kanban — Experimental vertical slice (human + agent shared workspaces)

Hermes Kanban now has two deliberately separate modes under the same canonical
per-board SQLite owner:

- **Agentic Kanban** remains the existing operational task state machine
  (`triage` → `ready` → `running` → terminal states), dispatcher, runs,
  dependencies and Workstation task lineage.
- **Hybrid Kanban** is a shared human/agent workspace of named boards, columns
  and cards. Its columns are user organization only: moving a Hybrid card to a
  column named “Done” never calls `kanban_complete` or dispatches work.

Implemented vertical slice:

- additive `hybrid_*` tables in the canonical `hermes_cli.kanban_db` database;
- one transaction-backed domain path (`hermes_cli.hybrid_kanban`) for API and
  agent-tool mutations, with actor/session provenance in `hybrid_activity`;
- deterministic dense ordering with a private temporary rank namespace to make
  swaps/reorders atomic under SQLite's unique rank constraints;
- optimistic-concurrency rejection through `expected_revision` for stale card
  and column operations;
- authenticated Kanban plugin API, `kanban_hybrid` agent tool, and an Electron
  Desktop shared-board page for creating boards/columns/cards, editing Markdown
  text and dragging cards between columns;
- restart persistence and Agentic-boundary behavior covered by Python tests;
- explicit **“Entregar isto ao Hermes”** delegation creates a separate canonical
  Agentic task in the same Kanban database, maintains a persistent bidirectional
  link, and projects compact status/result/evidence back to the human card;
- archive/restore and explicit hard-delete semantics, persisted activity,
  horizontal column reorder, revision checks, and precise invalidation over the
  existing plugin `/events` boundary are implemented and covered.
- multiple per-card checklists, revision-safe item completion/reorder/delete,
  restart persistence, activity provenance, canonical plugin RPC and Desktop
  card-drawer controls are implemented and covered.

Hardening remaining:

- multi-user authorization beyond the existing authenticated Dashboard session
  boundary, Hybrid-card comments/attachments and external-board connectors.

## V2.5 — Agent Runtime + System Capability Control Plane — Completed

### Agent Runtime / Worker Registry — Completed (`workstation/workers.py`)

Workstation-level abstraction for specialist agent harnesses without replacing Hermes as the primary conductor.

- Normalized discovery, installation/readiness, invocation, task handoff, cancellation and health across compatible worker agents (`WorkerRegistry`, `WorkerHarnessInfo`, `DelegatedTaskHandoff`).
- Delegation of bounded subtasks to workers (Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity, OpenCode, K-Tools-Neo) while retaining canonical Hermes task/session/card lineage in `ExecutionJournal`.
- Auditable recording of worker execution steps in canonical journal events.
- All worker details preserved behind clean adapters without leaking into Workstation core.

### System Capability Layer — Completed (`workstation/host.py`)

Generalized safe host-capability boundary for operations outside the browser.

- Filesystem and workspace operations (`inspect_workspace`);
- Process/application launch and command execution (`run_command`);
- Clipboard read/write handoff (`read_clipboard`, `write_clipboard`);
- Git operations (`git_status`);
- Desktop notifications (`send_notification`);
- Machine diagnostics and hardware metrics (`get_diagnostics`).
- Providers implemented: `WindowsHostCapabilityProvider`, `LinuxHostCapabilityProvider`, and `KToolsNeoCapabilityAdapter` (candidate external automation adapter without hard dependency).

### System Event → Hermes Task pipeline — Completed (`workstation/events.py`)

Inverse automation direction surfacing system events back into canonical Hermes task model (`SystemEventPipeline`).

- Supported event classes: `PROCESS_CRASH`, `BUILD_FAILURE`, `BUILD_SUCCESS`, `DOWNLOAD_COMPLETED`, `REPO_STATE_CHANGED`, `CONTROLLER_HEALTH_CHANGED`, `LONG_RUNNING_JOB_COMPLETED`, `USER_ATTENTION_REQUIRED`.
- Translates critical/untracked events into canonical Kanban tasks via `WorkstationKanbanBridge` and enriches active tasks via `ExecutionJournal`.
- Strict retention of provenance, reason, and execution evidence without duplicate schedulers or stores.

### Scoped autonomy / Policy Engine — Completed (`workstation/policy.py`)

Explicit scoped autonomy classifying actions into deterministic security outcomes:

```text
allow
sandbox / constrain
require human confirmation
deny
```

- Enforces least privilege per task/capability;
- Sensitive OS directory protection (`C:\Windows`, `/etc`, `~/.ssh`) and dangerous command pattern protection (`rm -rf /`, `format`, fork bombs) -> `DENY`;
- Out-of-workspace writes and financial/irreversible actions -> `REQUIRE_APPROVAL`;
- Untrusted executions -> `SANDBOX`;
- Full auditable evaluation trail preserved for every action.

### Agent Control Center / observability — Completed (`apps/desktop/src/app/browser/task-rail.tsx`, `task-journal-drawer.tsx`)

Live task rail, task grouping, interactive journal replay player, download drawer, and execution lineage inspection.

## V3 — Cross-platform Agentic Workstation — Completed

### Omarchy as Linux reference host — Completed (`workstation/omarchy.py`)

- `OmarchyAdapter` detecting Omarchy environment, default coding agent, system skills, and normalized agent CLI launcher without distro-specific file hacking.

### Cross-platform host adapters — Completed (`workstation/cross_platform.py`)

- `CrossPlatformHostManager` providing unified capability discovery, execution normalization, and host summaries across Windows and Linux.

### Agentic Desktop Reference Tracking — Completed (`workstation/cross_platform.py` - `AgenticBenchmarkRegistry`)

Lightweight architectural benchmark registry tracking:
1. Omarchy
2. Hermes Upstream
3. OpenHands
4. OpenCode
5. Claude Code
6. Codex
7. Antigravity
8. BrowserOS

Evaluating all 4 core architectural questions:
1. Problem solved?
2. Does Hermes have this problem?
3. Expressible in Hermes contracts?
4. Upstream-delta safe?

### V3 Target Experience — Fulfilled

```text
one user request
  → canonical Hermes task/session/card
  → Hermes plans/orchestrates
  → optional specialist worker executes a bounded subtask
  → Browser and/or host capability adapters act under scoped policy
  → system events can wake or enrich the same task
  → journal/evidence/recovery stay attached to the canonical lineage
  → the same semantic workflow can run on supported Windows or Linux hosts
```

### V3.1–V3.4 implementation status — 2026-09-12

The planned Python contract layer is implemented in `workstation/` and is
validated by 175 Workstation tests plus the versioned Windows process-boundary
probe `context/engineering-journal/probes/v3-runtime-hardening-smoke.py`.
The implementation extends the existing owners: `ExecutionJournal`,
`ProceduralMemory`, `WorkerRegistry`, Hermes sessions, Kanban and BrowserTask;
it does not add a parallel canonical store or model tool.

Implemented surfaces include:

- EvidenceState and durable reconciliation, bounded RuntimeEventBus with
  journal mirroring, deadlines/cancellation, typed reconnectable resources and
  task-scoped budget/model routing;
- independent subprocess RuntimeSupervisor with watchdog restart/checkpoints,
  Recovery Plane quarantine/diagnostics and a dependency-light recovery CLI;
- discover → validate → promote → deterministic routine replay with fail-closed
  drift handling and journal lineage;
- persistent WorkerRegistry queue/message/steer/wait/stop/reconstruct lifecycle,
  structured result envelopes and parent wake-up events;
- typed temporal memory, recoverable snapshots, hot/warm/cold session metadata,
  migration rollback, explicit compaction markers, portable redacted traces,
  side-effect-free replay/fork and model-independent evaluation/soak gates;
- explicit scoped memory compaction for operational task context, with soak
  evidence proving a bounded live-record set without pruning procedures or
  unrelated memory kinds;
- versioned hidden-window native Browser runtime reconnect soak with real
  Electron/Chromium pages, composite state restoration and resource lineage;
- versioned real headless `hermes serve` multi-session/reconnect soak with
  authenticated WebSocket traffic, streamed turns and durable session resume;
- versioned H013 integrated hidden-window Desktop/Browser load E2E with four
  native Chromium BrowserTasks, complete controller/IPC resource-event parity,
  host-aware viewport transfer, native maximize/restore reconciliation and
  lifecycle cleanup, plus
  an expanded eight-task/three-round sustained backend load and a bounded
  16-task/120-second candidate-release profile with checked JSON evidence via
  `workstation.desktop_load_evidence`;
- Control Plane action/spend/network/permission observation, degraded optional
  boot, bounded MCP execution, extension qualification and versioned A2A/ACP/UHP
  adapters;
- production dependency audit gate with the vulnerable transitive frontend
  packages refreshed in the lockfile without forced upgrades.

The remaining roadmap acceptance gates are evidence gates, not unimplemented
contracts: clean-machine release qualification, broader event/resource parity
for future clients and candidate-release confirmation of the full-duration/
production-scale Desktop/Browser agent/backend profile beyond the locally
validated H013 run. The
`workstation.release_qualification` runner and canonical reconnect soak make
those checks reproducible without inferring clean-machine or Desktop/Browser
production evidence. The Chromium/Firefox smoke is validated, and the optional
installed Edge project is also validated when the supported system browser is
available; neither is claimed as a full release qualification.

## V3.1 — Runtime Resilience, Recovery Plane & Deterministic Routine Promotion — Implemented contract layer

**Purpose:** harden Hermes Workstation as a long-lived agentic system by separating the mechanisms that keep the runtime alive, rescue a broken installation, and replay already-understood workflows from the LLM-driven reasoning path.

This milestone extends existing V2 procedural memory and V2.5 runtime/control-plane work; it must **not** introduce a second Hermes SessionDB, Kanban, Memory store, browser page store, task scheduler, or competing source of truth.

### Independent Runtime Supervisor — Implemented contract

The process responsible for keeping Hermes alive must live outside the agent runtime it supervises.

- Add a minimal supervisor/service process that owns runtime start, health checks, restart, crash-loop detection and controlled shutdown.
- The agent runtime may request restart/update, but must never depend on itself remaining alive to complete its own resurrection.
- Track a last-known-good runtime/profile checkpoint and detect failed startup after update or configuration change.
- Support safe update handoff and rollback without requiring the Desktop UI to remain functional.
- Emit lifecycle events into the existing Workstation event/journal path instead of creating a parallel operational history.

**Acceptance:** deliberately crash or self-stop the Hermes runtime and prove the independent supervisor restores service or rolls back to a known-good state without relying on the dead runtime.

### Recovery Plane / Safe Mode — Implemented contract

Recovery must remain available even when the normal Workstation UI, plugin graph, browser surface, or agent runtime is unhealthy.

- Add a minimal out-of-band recovery surface, CLI and/or safe-mode UI with deliberately tiny dependencies.
- Expose runtime health, startup diagnostics and the minimum logs/evidence required to identify a failed component.
- Allow disabling/quarantining a broken optional plugin or integration without manually editing internal state files.
- Allow restoring the last-known-good profile/checkpoint and restarting through the independent supervisor.
- Support degraded boot: optional component failure should isolate that component and keep the core available unless safety or state-integrity invariants require fail-closed behavior.
- Keep Recovery Plane independent from rich Desktop/plugin rendering so the recovery mechanism does not share the same primary failure domain.

**Acceptance:** break the normal Workstation UI or an optional plugin intentionally and recover to an operational state using only the Recovery Plane, with no manual repository/profile surgery.

### Routine promotion — discover → validate → promote → deterministic replay — Implemented contract

V2 `ProceduralMemory` already captures reusable knowledge from successful workflows. V3.1 adds an explicit promotion boundary so a workflow that is understood and validated no longer requires the LLM to rediscover every step on every run.

- Capture a successful agent-discovered workflow with provenance, ordered actions, required inputs, preconditions, expected outputs and evidence.
- Require explicit validation policy (human approval and/or strong automated evidence) before promotion from learned procedure to deterministic routine.
- Store/version the reusable procedure through the existing Hermes Memory/skill ownership path; do not create a second memory authority.
- Execute promoted routines through a deterministic runner whenever their declared preconditions match.
- Record routine version, inputs, actions, outputs and evidence in the existing Execution Journal/Kanban lineage.
- If reality diverges from the routine's assumptions, stop deterministic replay and hand control back to Hermes for diagnosis/re-exploration through the existing drift-governance path.
- Allow revised successful behavior to produce a new routine version rather than silently mutating historical behavior.

**Acceptance:** let Hermes discover a real multi-step workflow once, validate/promote it, replay it later without repeated LLM planning, then deliberately introduce drift and prove execution stops safely and returns control to the agent.

### Architectural boundary

```text
Independent Supervisor
  → keeps runtime alive / restarts / rolls back

Recovery Plane
  → rescues the system when normal Workstation paths are unhealthy

Agent Runtime
  → reasons, plans, coordinates and handles novel/drifted situations

Deterministic Routine Runner
  → replays validated known workflows without repeated LLM reasoning

Workstation
  → presents state, control, evidence and recovery entrypoints to the user
```

The intended workflow lifecycle becomes:

```text
novel task
  → Hermes reasons and discovers a working procedure
  → evidence + validation gate
  → promote to versioned deterministic routine
  → future compatible task replays the routine cheaply and predictably
  → unexpected state/drift stops replay
  → Hermes resumes reasoning and adapts
  → revised behavior may be validated as a new routine version
```

### V3.1 exit criteria

- runtime crash/self-stop recovery succeeds without the runtime supervising its own resurrection;
- one broken optional plugin/UI path can be isolated and recovered through the out-of-band Recovery Plane;
- last-known-good restore/rollback is demonstrably usable when a new runtime/profile fails startup;
- one real agent-discovered workflow is promoted and replayed deterministically with canonical journal/Kanban evidence;
- deterministic replay fails closed on unmet preconditions or drift and hands control back to Hermes;
- no duplicate SessionDB, Kanban, Memory, browser state or task scheduler is introduced;
- Windows dogfood evidence exists first, with the supervisor/recovery contracts designed so Linux can implement the same semantics.

## Research intake — 2026-09-10 — cross-briefing architecture backlog

This intake consolidates actionable Hermes Workstation implications extracted from the
Hermes Agent, DeepSeek Harness and broader agentic-systems briefings through
2026-09-10. It records both **new gaps** and **disposition of ideas already covered**
so research does not create duplicate owners or reopen completed milestones.

### Non-negotiable interpretation

- Hermes remains the primary conductor and canonical owner of Hermes sessions,
  Kanban and Memory; Workstation must not become a second agent core.
- Workstation owns the product/control layer around Hermes: canonical cross-surface
  state, policy, supervision, recovery, evidence, operational UX and selected
  compatibility adapters.
- Prefer upstream capability reuse over downstream reimplementation. Every new
  downstream feature needs an explicit `own / adapt / upstream` decision and an
  upstream-delta/compatibility check.
- Runtime/Data Plane must never be able to silently weaken the Control Plane that
  constrains it.
- Long-lived operation is the target: architecture must remain safe and observable
  across days, restarts, model/provider changes, plugin failures and upgrades.

### Research disposition — already covered or substantially represented

The following research themes are already represented in completed/planned roadmap
work and should be hardened there rather than reimplemented:

- browser-visible persistent profile/session ownership → Foundation, V1 and V1.1;
- popup/SSO, upload/download and browser recovery → V1;
- scoped capability policy, approval and audit trail → V2.5 Policy Engine;
- specialist worker adapters and canonical delegated-task lineage → V2.5 Worker Registry;
- system-event-to-task ingestion → V2.5 Event Pipeline;
- execution observability/journal → V1/V2.5 Control Center;
- procedural memory, provenance-aware perception and drift governance → V2;
- cross-platform host awareness → V2.5/V3;
- independent supervisor, safe-mode Recovery Plane, last-known-good rollback and
  deterministic routine promotion → V3.1.

The items below are the remaining research-derived gaps or explicit hardening
requirements.

## V3.2 — Evidence-backed Long-Lived Runtime & AgentOps — Implemented contract layer

**Purpose:** make “running” mean demonstrably running, make long-lived sessions and
workers operationally bounded, and expose one coherent runtime state to every
Workstation surface.

This milestone extends V3.1. It must reuse the canonical `ExecutionJournal`,
Kanban, BrowserTask, Hermes session/memory owners, `WorkerRegistry`, Policy Engine
and supervisor; it must not introduce parallel task/session/memory stores.

### EvidenceState + explicit execution state machine — Implemented contract

Introduce `EvidenceState` as a first-class projection over canonical task/run state.

At minimum a running operation should be able to expose:

```text
status
started_at
last_activity
evidence[]:
  process_id | browser_operation | worker_id | job_id | upload_id |
  watcher_id | external_handle
recovery_strategy
blocked_reason?
approval_id?
```

Rules:

- `running` requires live/verifiable operational evidence, not only an agent claim.
- Distinguish at least `ready`, `queued`, `running`, `waiting-for-human`,
  `blocked`, `stalled`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled` and `hold`.
- A worker safety stop, missing approval or external failure must never be reported
  upstream as normal completion.
- Explicit user constraints and target project/workspace identifiers override
  implicit “currently active” UI/session context.
- A stale evidence record must degrade state instead of allowing zombie “running”.
- Recovery actions must be linked to the same canonical run/task lineage.

**Acceptance:** kill a worker, browser operation, gateway or upload mid-run and
prove the UI/state projection stops claiming progress without evidence and offers
the correct recovery/handoff state.

### Event bus, deadlines and backpressure — Implemented contract

Harden runtime ↔ cockpit communication into a complete event contract.

- First-class events for tool calls, worker messages, progress, usage/cost,
  approvals, errors, lifecycle transitions, deliverables and recovery.
- No operation may wait forever: model calls, MCP requests/pagination, WebSocket
  sends, file transfers, persistence, provider calls and worker waits require
  deadline, cancellation and bounded retries.
- One blocked WebSocket/message must not head-of-line block unrelated events/RPCs.
- Prefer event-driven `wait`/wake semantics over context-expensive polling.
- UI reconnect must follow an explicit lifecycle (`connecting → restoring →
  ready`) before querying state aggressively.
- Structural failures must become visible states; no silent no-op buttons or
  swallowed persistence failures.

**Acceptance:** inject a stuck event/channel and prove unrelated task events
continue; cancellation/deadline produces an auditable terminal state.

### Durable session ownership, migration and memory lifecycle — Implemented contract

Treat persistent conversation history and a live persistent agent as separate
recovery concerns.

- Enforce cross-process ownership/locking for a writable session/run.
- Treat session schema changes as state migrations:
  `backup → migrate → validate → promote → rollback`.
- Preserve the original representation until migration is validated.
- Persist enough identity to reconstruct agent/model/tool/worker bindings rather
  than restoring only transcript text.
- Provide administrative model-binding migration for existing long-lived sessions
  when default provider/model changes.
- Add `hot / warm / cold` session lifecycle so inactive sessions can leave RAM and
  be reconstructed from durable state.
- Trigger context compaction before model quality or cost collapses, not merely at
  the provider's hard limit.
- Preserve compaction/replay markers and surface persistence corruption/recovery
  as observable events.
- Version/snapshot important user/memory state so current-state files are not the
  only recoverable copy.

**Acceptance:** run a long-session soak with multiple sessions, force restart and
model change, migrate one session, unload/reload cold sessions, and prove identity,
history and ownership recover without unbounded memory growth.

### Persistent workers: queue → message → steer → wait → stop — Implemented contract

Extend `WorkerRegistry` beyond fire-and-return delegation.

- Optional persistent specialist worker identities with durable parent/task lineage.
- Ordered message queue with sender identity and provenance.
- `send_message`, `steer`, `wait`, `stop/cancel` and resumable worker semantics.
- Parent-owned relay for worker questions:
  `worker → Hermes parent → user/approval surface → parent → worker`.
- Worker result envelope must include semantic status, model/provider, duration,
  token/usage estimate, cost estimate when available, produced evidence and
  explicit deliverables.
- Parent must be awakened by meaningful worker delivery/event instead of polling.
- Support bounded parallel hypothesis generation + verifier/selection for
  high-complexity work, while keeping it opt-in and budget governed.

**Acceptance:** keep one worker alive across multiple messages, steer it mid-run,
pause/resume or reconstruct it, then stop it deterministically with complete
journal/evidence and cost metadata.

### Cost, budget and model/provider routing — Implemented contract

Make selection of intelligence an operational policy rather than a UI-only choice.

- Budget per task/run/worker, not only post-hoc global usage.
- Route by `complexity × risk × quality × cost × latency × availability`.
- Cheap/local model for routine execution when adequate; stronger model for
  planning, diagnosis, verification and exceptions.
- Provider/model fallback must be explicit, observable and policy-bounded.
- A material increase in possible spend requires approval.
- Heartbeat/loop/cron checks should decide whether a model call is needed before
  sending giant session context; use minimal context/cheap policy paths when possible.
- Large tool/skill catalogs should be discovered/injected on demand instead of
  repeatedly invalidating provider caches.
- Provider auth/TLS/proxy/base-URL differences are operational facts, not assumed
  interchangeable implementation details; localhost/LAN service traffic must not
  be accidentally forced through external proxies.

**Acceptance:** execute the same workload under at least two routing strategies and
report quality/status, latency, usage/cost and fallback decisions in canonical
journal metadata.

### Typed Resources + one runtime / many clients — Implemented contract

The first client boundary is now wired: Electron's BrowserTask/page owner
publishes bounded, versioned resource and event projections through its
authenticated loopback controller. Desktop IPC and the Dashboard REST route
consume those projections, while the TUI gateway exposes the same read-only
adapters for future clients. Degraded controller health is explicit and
permissions fail closed to `read`; no client creates a second task or journal
store.

Formalize a UI-neutral resource contract so capabilities publish typed state and
interfaces decide how to render it.

Examples:

```text
BrowserTask        → browser resource
ExecutionJournal   → timeline/evidence resource
Kanban             → task/dependency resource
Worker             → terminal/log/result resource
ProceduralMemory   → procedure resource
Artifact delivery  → deliverable resource
```

Requirements:

- Desktop, browser/WebUI, future mobile/remote clients are views over the same
  canonical runtime, not separate agent implementations.
- Resource identity, permissions and lineage survive client detach/reconnect.
- Separate internal workspace artifacts from **explicit deliverables** promoted to
  the user; “file touched” is not equivalent to “file delivered”.
- UI defaults to outcome/progress/cost/state; deep logs remain inspectable rather
  than flooding the primary surface.
- No internal agent chain-of-thought/private scratch state is required for the
  resource contract; only operationally useful state/evidence is exposed.

**Acceptance:** open the same running task from two supported surfaces and prove
both resolve identical canonical resources without duplicate workers/pages/tasks.

Current adapter evidence covers the Dashboard REST and TUI JSON-RPC surfaces
over one authenticated controller projection, with identical browser,
BrowserTask, execution-journal and bounded event identities. The exact packaged
artifact also passes the complete headless Desktop GUI/HUD smoke and IPC/
controller identity checks; visible desktop-session reveal and future remote
clients remain separate evidence gates.

### Human Handoff contract — Implemented contract

Generalize existing take/release-control primitives into a task-level human handoff.

- Agent may request handoff for login, CAPTCHA, 2FA, sensitive confirmation,
  ambiguous high-risk controls or automation failure.
- Preserve the same browser/session/task identity while control changes hands.
- Make handoff state explicit and auditable; resume only after a deliberate return
  of control.
- For personal-browser bridges, scope authorization to explicit tab/domain/session,
  permit immediate revocation and avoid exposing stored credentials to the agent.

**Acceptance:** agent reaches an authenticated workflow, yields to user, user
completes login/2FA, returns the same session, and the agent continues with no
duplicate page/profile.

## V3.3 — Isolation, Protocol Governance & Supply-Chain Hardening — Implemented contract layer

### Control Plane boundary + independent watchdog — Implemented contract

Extend the V2.5 Policy Engine and V3.1 supervisor with an independent policy/watch
path that cannot perform ordinary task work.

- Observe actions, spend, network destinations, permission changes and critical
  lifecycle events.
- Detect expansion to a previously undeclared external surface and default to
  `suspend → journal → request approval`.
- Policy authority, secret scopes, sandbox mode, restart/recovery and permission
  elevation live above the agent/Data Plane.
- Runtime components cannot call an unprotected local control API to remove their
  own confinement.
- Distinguish trusted vs untrusted workspaces/content and propagate trust labels
  into policy decisions.
- Preserve an incident trace showing the sequence of decisions/actions that led to
  a privileged or anomalous operation.

### Plugin / Skill / MCP isolation and degraded boot — Implemented contract

Optional components must fail independently.

- A broken plugin/skill/MCP server must not prevent core Workstation boot unless
  canonical state integrity or safety requires fail-closed behavior.
- Quarantine/disable optional components through Recovery Plane.
- Version extension contracts and provide safe defaults for newly introduced
  capabilities.
- Bound MCP discovery/execution by maximum pages, tools, response size, time and
  cancellation even when each page/cursor is formally valid.
- Supervise MCP processes/lifecycle as external dependencies, including health,
  restart and observable failure.
- Plugin/skill install pipeline should evolve toward:
  `source/provenance → static inspection → requested capabilities → sandbox →
  behavioral smoke → signature/reputation → install`.
- Secrets/credentials exposed to extensions should be scoped and preferably
  write-only/non-readable where practical.

### Protocol boundary / interoperability — Implemented contract

Keep Workstation semantics independent of any one external protocol.

- MCP remains a tool/data adapter, not canonical task state.
- Add/assess agent↔agent interoperability through A2A where it reduces bespoke
  worker coupling.
- Treat ACP/UHP-style runtime/client protocols as adapters/candidates for external
  clients, not new state owners.
- The internal event/resource/lifecycle contract must preserve tool events,
  approvals, usage, errors and cancellation even if an external protocol omits them.
- Version protocol adapters and test compatibility explicitly.

### Upstream ownership & release qualification gate — Implemented contract

For every upstream Hermes update:

1. classify each overlapping capability as `upstream-owned`, `Workstation-owned`
   or `adapter-owned`;
2. compare imported commit/version, packaged assets and expected integrations;
3. run clean-machine install/build from the exact candidate release with an
   absolute isolated Workstation home outside the checkout, shared by install
   and doctor;
4. execute Workstation contract/eval smoke, Windows-native smoke and migration
   preflight;
5. promote only after validation; retain last-known-good rollback.

A stable upstream tag must never be assumed equivalent to `main`, and local caches
must never be allowed to hide missing release dependencies.

## V3.4 — Memory, Time, Replay & Evaluation — Implemented contract layer

### Typed memory + temporal awareness — Implemented contract

Build typed policy views over existing Hermes Memory ownership, not a second memory DB.

Different memory classes need different retention/retrieval semantics:

- task/work context;
- factual/project knowledge;
- decisions and rationale;
- user preferences/principles (kept separate from operational facts);
- reusable procedures/routines;
- provenance/evidence/checkpoints.

Add:

- versioning/snapshots and recoverable history;
- workspace scoping;
- bounded recall/token budgets;
- provenance;
- confidence/validation metadata where useful;
- temporal decay/staleness;
- explicit `created_at / observed_at / last_verified_at`;
- elapsed-time awareness for pending tasks, promises, stale decisions and recovery.

### Portable trace, replay and model fork — Implemented contract

Extend Execution Journal toward operational replay/evaluation.

- Produce a portable incident/execution trace with canonical event IDs and resource
  references.
- Support offline replay for diagnosis without re-performing side effects.
- Permit controlled “fork at event N with another model/worker” experiments in an
  isolated evaluation environment.
- Preserve exact model/provider/tool/policy/version metadata needed to explain why
  behavior changed between runs.

### Evaluation & efficiency gates — Implemented contract

- Model-independent harness evals separate model quality from harness/runtime quality.
- Long-duration soak tests for sessions, workers, memory and reconnect behavior.
- Multi-process ownership tests for sessions/resources.
- Cross-engine WebUI smoke where applicable: Chromium/Edge and Firefox first;
  WebKit/Safari when/if a supported client target exists.
- Regression budgets for action/tool count, latency, context tokens and recovery
  success so a change that “works” but becomes dramatically less efficient is visible.
- Critical workflows follow `hypothesis → action → verify final state → report
  evidence`; completion should be evidence-backed, not response-backed.
- Before deployment/promotion, evaluate technical behavior, safety and compatibility
  against a reproducible baseline.

## Workstation Knowledge Subsystem — Hermes Vault (Local-First Agentic PKM)

Hermes Workstation bridges human personal knowledge management and autonomous agent capability into a single shared, local-first medium: **Hermes Vault**. Rather than treating notes as external third-party software, Hermes Desktop exposes a first-class Obsidian-compatible Markdown vault where both the human and the agent co-author notes, link ideas, and navigate knowledge.

Current verified slice (2026-09-15): the Markdown owner, plugin RPC, Desktop
route/editor/preview/backlinks and `d3-force` graph are present. Filesystem
containment is enforced before mutations, symlinked notes/directories are
excluded, writes are atomic, and the process-wide manager runs a bounded,
debounced external-change watcher. Persistent custom-root selection, richer
CodeMirror live editing/`[[` completion, explicit MOC/synthesis flows and the
remaining product-polish contracts below stay open; they are not implied by
the existing MVP.

### Core Architectural Slices

1. **Vault Engine & Local Indexer (`workstation/vault.py`)**:
   - Local directory root (default `~/.hermes/vault` or user-selected custom/Obsidian folder).
   - Real-time filesystem watcher for `.md` documents.
   - Regex/AST indexer for bidirectional wikilinks (`[[Note Name]]`, `[[Note#Section]]`), `#tags`, and YAML frontmatter properties.
   - Fast in-memory graph cache (forward references and backlinks index).

2. **Desktop UI & Editor (`apps/desktop/src/app/vault`)**:
   - First-class `/vault` route in Hermes Desktop.
   - Master-detail vault explorer with folder tree, search filter, and tag list.
   - WYSIWYG / Live Preview Markdown editor with syntax highlighting, task lists, KaTeX math, and GitHub alerts / Obsidian Callouts (`> [!NOTE]`).
   - Typing `[[` triggers auto-complete suggestion for existing notes.
   - Contextual right rail showing incoming Backlinks and outgoing Links.

3. **Knowledge Graph View**:
   - Interactive 2D/3D force-directed knowledge graph leveraging the proven `starmap` simulation engine (`d3-force`).
   - Nodes represent notes and tags; edges represent bidirectional wikilinks.
   - Interactive zoom, pan, filter by tag, and click-to-open.

4. **Agent-Vault Bridge Tools**:
   - Model tools for Hermes: `vault_search`, `vault_read`, `vault_write`, `vault_append`, `vault_backlinks`, and `vault_graph`; do not add the historical `vault_create_note` alias without a demonstrated compatibility need.
   - Explicit, opt-in agent synthesis: converting browser research, conversation takeaways, and project decisions into connected notes.
   - Map of Content (MOC) generator for automated knowledge clustering.

## V3.5 — Browser Automation Ergonomics & Autonomous Web Operations

Evolved from real dogfood observation across complex web properties (Google Maps SPAs, Amazon product grids, GitHub Turbopack filters, Mercado Livre verification walls).

1. **Input Hygiene & Reliable Value Replacement (`browser_type`)**:
   - Support `clear: true` (default `true` for input/searchbox elements) with multi-strategy CDP clearing: Ctrl+A with explicit `windowsVirtualKeyCode: 65`, `execCommand('selectAll')`, Backspace sequence, and direct DOM fallback.
   - Prevents search token duplication (e.g., `is:issue state:open is:issue state:open label:...`) across hotwired / auto-completing search inputs.

2. **Proactive Human Handoff & Auth/Verification Wall Detection**:
   - Pattern-based detection for account verification gates (`/gz/account-verification`, `/challenge`, Cloudflare Turnstile, CAPTCHA, Auth0, Google Sign-In).
   - Triggers proactive Human Takeover alert in Hermes Desktop with persistent session benefit: human logs in once in the dedicated Workstation profile, agent resumes seamlessly.

3. **Canvas / WebGL SPA Awareness & Adaptive DOM Settlement**:
   - Detects empty accessibility trees (`element_count <= 2` with active canvas or dynamic feed loaders) on rich web apps (Google Maps, Figma, web dashboards).
   - Implements adaptive DOM settling and feed detection (`div[role="feed"]`, main articles, etc.) before snapshot generation, preventing 0-element blindness.

4. **Batch Structured Extraction (`browser_extract_items`)**:
   - First-class structured extraction tool/primitive that collects repetitive items (cards, products, issues, articles) with selectors, attributes, text, and URLs in a single agent step.
   - Eliminates excessive token consumption and 10+ consecutive `browser_console` JS injection cycles for table/grid scraping.

## V4 radar — optional / evidence-gated explorations

These are research-backed directions worth preserving without making them near-term
dependencies:

- **distributed local compute pool:** discover trusted LAN machines/models as
  replaceable inference capacity rather than assuming local model == this GPU;
- **hardened worker sandbox lane:** Windows host → WSL/container/sandbox for
  untrusted/continuous worker execution while native Desktop remains the product shell;
- **OAuth connection broker:** user-friendly scoped connections for external
  services instead of routine raw API-key copying;
- **mobile/remote client:** thin authenticated client over the same canonical runtime,
  with pairing, device revocation and approval cards;
- **tool-learning / WebMCP-style promotion:** `explore → validate → promote to
  versioned tool/routine → reuse`, integrated with V3.1 deterministic promotion;
- **large-search orchestration:** many cheap independent attempts + selection +
  progressively stronger verification for problems that justify the budget;
- **agent governance primitives:** independent verifier/auditor roles for high-stakes
  multiagent workflows, with human authority remaining outside the agent society.

### Human card → Hermes Agent Task delegation bridge — Implemented

**Purpose:** turn the hybrid/Trello-like human Kanban into a true delegation
interface for Hermes without collapsing human work management and agent execution
into one lifecycle.

A human-owned card may expose an explicit **“Entregar isto ao Hermes”** action.
Invoking that action must:

- preserve the original human card as the source of truth for the human workflow;
- create a separate canonical Hermes Agent Task with a stable bidirectional link
  (`human_card_id` ↔ `agent_task_id`) and explicit delegation provenance;
- execute and transition the Agent Task only through the existing agentic Kanban,
  Hermes session/run, BrowserTask, Worker and Execution Journal owners;
- project useful agent progress back onto the human card without making that
  projection authoritative for the Agent Task lifecycle;
- on completion, failure or cancellation, return the result, deliverables, concise
  summary and relevant evidence to the original human card while preserving the
  full agent-side journal/history;
- keep human columns/statuses and agent execution states semantically independent:
  moving/completing a human card must not silently complete/cancel the Agent Task,
  and an agent-side transition must not silently move the human card unless an
  explicit user action or declared policy requests it;
- preserve delegation lineage across restart/recovery, and treat re-delegation as
  an explicit new attempt/task (or conscious reuse) rather than overwriting prior
  execution evidence.

The intended flow is:

```text
human Trello-like card
  → “Entregar isto ao Hermes”
  → linked canonical Agent Task
  → execution visible in the Agentic Kanban
  → journal / evidence / deliverables produced under agent lifecycle
  → result + evidence projected back to the original human card
```

**Acceptance:** delegate one human card, prove the original card remains in its
human board lifecycle while the linked Agent Task independently moves through
queued/running/waiting/completed states, then verify that completion returns the
result/evidence to the same human card and that restart/recovery preserves the
link without introducing a second canonical Kanban/task store.

Implementation evidence on the current mainline working tree:

- `hybrid_card_delegations` is an additive table in the canonical
  `hermes_cli.kanban_db` owner; no AgentTaskStore or parallel queue was added.
- duplicate clicks are idempotent for an active attempt; retry is an explicit
  reuse of the same attempt, while re-delegation creates a new attempt and
  preserves prior evidence.
- `tests/hermes_cli/test_hybrid_kanban.py` covers delegation, restart,
  completion/failure/cancellation, independent movement and result/evidence
  writeback.

### Research-derived acceptance principle

A roadmap item should only be promoted from “interesting” to “default path” after it
demonstrates at least one of:

- measurable reliability or recovery improvement;
- lower cost/latency at equal task success;
- stronger safety/isolation with preserved usability;
- clearer canonical state/evidence across restarts/clients;
- reduced upstream-delta/maintenance burden.

The objective is not to make Hermes Workstation contain every agent feature. The
objective is to make upstream Hermes **predictable, observable, recoverable,
policy-bounded and pleasant to operate for long periods**.

## Active: Canonical Work Loop
