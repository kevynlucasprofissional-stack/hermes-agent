# Hermes Workstation

Hermes Workstation is a thin downstream distribution of
`NousResearch/hermes-agent`. The upstream Hermes architecture remains the source
of truth for sessions, Kanban, memory, skills, Gateway, Desktop and Dashboard.
Workstation adds tightly integrated product capabilities rather than parallel
state.

## Primary development rule — upstream first

Every new Workstation code-change cycle starts by executing
[`context/UPSTREAM_FIRST_CHANGE_GATE_2026-09-20.md`](context/UPSTREAM_FIRST_CHANGE_GATE_2026-09-20.md).

The Workstation is not maintained as a long-lived patch stack that occasionally catches up.
The normal cycle is now:

```text
qualified upstream-aligned baseline
        ↓
seam reconciliation
        ↓
target downstream implementation
        ↓
exact-head qualification
        ↓
final upstream drift classification
```

This does **not** mean continuously chasing a moving upstream HEAD while implementing a
feature. One exact upstream SHA is pinned for the cycle; the baseline is made green first;
the target change is then implemented from that stable baseline.

## V1 invariants

1. **One Hermes state.** No Workstation session DB, task DB or memory DB when
   Hermes already owns that state.
2. **Browser is first-class.** The Desktop exposes `/browser` directly in core
   navigation.
3. **No external Chrome dependency.** The primary Browser runtime uses the
   Chromium bundled with Electron via `WebContentsView`.
4. **Persistent browser identity.** The Browser uses a dedicated Electron
   `Session` stored outside the repository.
5. **Background capable.** Browser WebContents survive route changes. The UI
   attaches/detaches the native view; it does not destroy the browser.
6. **Fail closed after binding.** A task bound to the internal browser pauses
   and recovers there; it never silently moves to another backend.
7. **Kanban is the task source of truth.** Multistep Workstation work maps to
   Hermes Kanban cards.
8. **Risk gates.** Sensitive/irreversible browser actions require approval.
9. **Evidence and reports.** Browser work produces a journal plus structured
   completion metadata.
10. **Upstream delta stays visible.** Every core change is documented in
    `UPSTREAM_DELTA.md`.
11. **Isolated Python runtime.** Development/runtime dependencies live in the
    repo-local `.venv`; Workstation never intentionally mutates the user's
    global Python environment.

## One-click Windows dogfood

For the normal personal/dogfood path, double-click the repository-root launcher:

```text
START-HERMES-WORKSTATION.bat
```

It orchestrates the canonical steps in order:

```text
install → doctor → start
```

The launcher stops on an installation/start failure and keeps the failure visible.
After installation succeeds it starts Desktop with `-SkipInstall`, so the same run
does not execute the dependency installation a second time.

Use the individual commands below when debugging or when you intentionally want
to run a single phase.

## Windows bootstrap

From the root of the Hermes fork, use the `.cmd` launchers. They start Windows
PowerShell with `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`, so the first run does not depend on
the machine's script execution policy:

```bat
workstation\install.cmd
workstation\doctor.cmd
```

Dependency installation is the normal installer path. `-InstallDependencies`
remains accepted for backwards compatibility; `-SkipDependencies` is the explicit
fast/diagnostic override when dependencies are already prepared and should not be
touched.

The installer creates/reuses `.venv` at the repository root and installs Hermes
there in editable mode. `.venv` is already ignored by Git. Node workspaces remain
managed by `npm ci`.

Then start Desktop development with:

```bat
workstation\start.cmd
```

`start.cmd` prepends `.venv\Scripts` to `PATH` and sets `VIRTUAL_ENV`/
`HERMES_PYTHON` before starting Electron, so the Desktop resolves this checkout's
Hermes backend instead of a global Python installation.

The one-click launcher uses the internal orchestration flag:

```bat
workstation\start.cmd -SkipInstall
```

Only use `-SkipInstall` after a successful install in the same orchestration or
when you deliberately know the checkout dependencies are already prepared.

The PowerShell entrypoints remain available when needed explicitly:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\workstation\install.ps1
```

The installer selects an available Python 3.13/3.12/3.11 through the Windows
`py` launcher when possible, validates every core patch anchor before writing,
and checks native-command exit codes. Dependency installation requires Hermes'
current Python range `>=3.11,<3.14` and Desktop requires Node `>=22.22.0` (the
repository `.nvmrc` selects Node 26; CI validates with Node 26).

## Browser integration

The integrated source provides a functional in-app Chromium Browser surface
**and** a loopback-authenticated controller used by Hermes `browser_*` tools.
Internal Chromium is the first browser lane; the official extension router and
legacy backend are fallback lanes only while routing is enabled and the task has
not bound to the persistent internal browser.

V1 #1 BrowserSessionState is promoted. It persists one atomic, versioned safe
structural projection for ordinary/task logical tabs, ordering, active state and
BrowserTask linkage while the dedicated Chromium profile separately owns
cookies/localStorage/IndexedDB. Exact-head H010 Windows/Electron evidence covers
clean and abrupt two-process restart, lazy one-page task recovery and failed-write
convergence.

The extraordinary pre-1.5 Mainline Consolidation Gate is PASS: predecessor PRs
are merged, historical diagnostics are closed/classified, and the full ledger is
in `context/MAINLINE_CONSOLIDATION.md`. V1 #1.5 is therefore the next
implementation track and must branch only from `main`.

Automatic Kanban promotion/orchestration, shared Chat/Hub hosting, LAN settings,
Execution Journal, procedural memory/perception/drift and specialist runtime
paths are implemented in the existing owners. The V3 runtime-hardening layer
adds evidence projections, bounded events/deadlines, independent supervision,
Recovery Plane CLI, deterministic routine promotion, persistent worker control,
temporal memory/snapshots, portable replay, protocol adapters and evaluation
gates without creating parallel SessionDB/Kanban/Memory/browser stores.

The V3 contract layer is validated by `workstation/tests/` and the versioned
Windows process-boundary probe
`context/engineering-journal/probes/v3-runtime-hardening-smoke.py`. The
read-only `workstation.release_qualification` runner now produces a bounded
  report for the local, native and migration stages and requires an explicit
  candidate-matched clean-install report. The shared `/resources` and bounded
  `/events` projections feed Desktop IPC, Dashboard REST and TUI JSON-RPC from
  the same Electron-owned state. `python -m workstation.soak` exercises
  canonical session/lease, journal and worker stop/reconstruct behavior with
  bounded duration and iteration evidence. The versioned H012 probe additionally
  drives the real headless `hermes serve` WebSocket backend through concurrent
  streamed turns and process restarts. The H013 E2E additionally exercises four
  native Chromium BrowserTasks through the hidden-window Desktop controller,
  IPC projection, host-aware viewport transfer and native maximize/restore
  reconciliation; the sustained gate also exercises eight tasks across three
  rounds and real backend chat turns. Product integration beyond the current
  resource adapters, clean-machine release qualification and full
  Desktop/Browser soak remain explicit evidence gates rather than implied by
  unit tests. The initial Chromium/Firefox Dashboard smoke is validated.
  Operational `TASK_CONTEXT` records in the reconnect scenario use explicit
  scoped compaction with persisted stale-writer reconciliation; the latest
  four-session soak kept live memory within its eight-record-per-session bound.
