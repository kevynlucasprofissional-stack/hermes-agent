### Internal Browser

The primary Workstation browser is not a second application. Hermes Desktop is
Electron, therefore it already ships an open-source Chromium runtime. Workstation
creates a dedicated Electron `Session` and manages one or more
`WebContentsView`s in the Desktop main process.

This is deliberately different from the existing Preview `<webview>`:

- Preview is a chat-adjacent rendering surface.
- Workstation Browser is a long-lived runtime owned by main.
- route changes only detach the view; WebContents keep running.
- all tabs share one persistent browser profile.
- agent control uses the same WebContents through CDP via a loopback-only authenticated controller.
- the profile does not share Hermes Desktop cookies.

Default Windows profile:

`%LOCALAPPDATA%\HermesWorkstation\Browser\User Data`

Linux/macOS use platform-appropriate configuration roots.

### BrowserRuntime abstraction

The product-level browser contract is runtime-neutral:

- `electron-chromium` — V1 primary, visible + persistent + background
- `agent-browser` — deterministic disposable fallback
- `browser-exec` — adaptive/power mode via Hermes Browser Use path
- `lightpanda` — future ultra-light headless runtime

Routing is configurable. When routing is disabled, Workstation uses only the
internal browser.

### BrowserTask lifecycle

`BrowserTask` is the logical identity of one durable browser job. It is not a
second tab/page store. For the Electron runtime, the existing `taskTabs` map and
`BrowserEntry.ownerTaskId` remain authoritative for the process-local binding
between a task and its live `WebContentsView`.

The lifecycle contract is:

```text
create(taskId)
  -> one task-owned live page at most

show(taskId, host/bounds)
  -> expose that task's existing page
  -> park a previously visible BrowserTask when necessary

hide(taskId)
  -> remove the page from the visible host
  -> keep page/task alive

park(taskId)
  -> keep the page alive in the background parking strategy
  -> keep page/task state

destroy(taskId)
  -> explicit terminal operation
  -> close/remove the owned live page
  -> remove BrowserTask metadata
```

Within one Electron process, `hide -> show` and `park -> show` must retain the
same live page and current navigation state. Repeating creation for the same
`taskId` is idempotent and must not allocate a second independently navigated
page.

BrowserTask metadata is safe structural state, separate from the Chromium
profile. The promoted composite BrowserSessionState includes identifiers/host
linkage, lifecycle status, parked state, lease/recovery state and timestamps
alongside ordinary/task logical tabs, order and active selection. It is
versioned and written atomically under the Workstation runtime directory.

A `WebContentsView` is process-local. On Desktop restart, Workstation restores
BrowserTask metadata as parked before creating any task page. When that task is
used again, the runtime lazily creates/reconnects one page under the same logical
`taskId` and records recovery. This is not serialization of the previous
renderer, JavaScript heap, or `WebContents` object. Browser profile-managed state
(cookies/localStorage/IndexedDB and compatible login state) persists separately.

The V1 #1.5 Chat Browser View, Browser Hub, and Workstation-mode Preview
compatibility slices must consume this same BrowserTask/BrowserRuntime state. A second UI surface may
show metadata/thumbnail while another owns the native live page; it must not
create an independently navigated duplicate for the same BrowserTask.

### Work/Kanban task lifecycle

```text
chat request
  -> classify as multistep/asynchronous work
  -> create Hermes Kanban card
  -> bind session/run/card
  -> choose BrowserRuntime if browser capability is needed
  -> bind/create BrowserTask for durable browser work
  -> journal actions/evidence
  -> create follow-up cards when discovered
  -> execute child only when required for parent
  -> complete card with summary + structured metadata
  -> report back into the originating chat
```

A discovered task must retain:

`parent_task_id`, `discovered_by`, `reason`, `evidence`,
`origin_session_id`.

BrowserTask may reference Hermes session/run/card identities, but it does not own
a second SessionDB, Kanban database, or Memory system.

### Safety

A browser task already bound to the internal runtime never silently fails over.
If browser/controller connectivity is lost:

`pause -> health/reconnect -> rebind -> verify -> resume`

Sensitive side effects cross an approval gate. The default policy covers
payments, send/publish, delete, contracts/terms, credentials/permissions,
money movement, irreversible actions and secrets entering a new context.

### LAN/mobile

LAN reuses the official `hermes dashboard` backend. It must never create a
second Workstation server or a second state store. Non-loopback bind is
fail-closed unless an official Hermes dashboard auth provider is configured.

V1 target:

`Desktop toggle -> auth verification -> dashboard bind -> IP detection -> QR`

Tailscale is V1.1.

## Source reuse

We adapt concepts/code only where that is architecturally valuable:

- `browser-use/desktop` MIT: WebContentsView pool/parking/lifecycle patterns.
- `hermes-browser-extension` MIT: browser-controller protocol, leases, safety,
  approvals and reconnect patterns.
- `browser-memory` MIT: procedural memory lifecycle, interface only in V1.
- `lattice` MIT: compact perception contract, interface only in V1.
- BrowserTrace/Witness/Driftlock: journal/replay/drift design references.
- BrowserOS: UX reference only; AGPL code is not incorporated.

See `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## V1 controller and routing order

```text
browser_* tool call
  -> Workstation router
     -> internal Electron Chromium when available
     -> if unavailable AND task is unbound AND routing is enabled:
          official Hermes extension router
          -> legacy local/cloud backend
     -> if task is already bound OR routing is disabled:
          fail closed and recover the internal runtime
```

The controller descriptor contains a random bearer token and loopback URL and is
written outside the repository with private-file permissions where supported.
It is never exposed through LAN mode. A successful internal browser action binds
the task/session to that runtime according to Workstation routing policy; a
bound BrowserTask must not silently fail over to a different browser lane with
different page/auth state.
