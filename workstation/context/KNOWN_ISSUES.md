# Workstation Known Issues


## KI-011 — Durable compiler can obstruct stateful native-browser work [OPEN — 2026-09-18]

**Observed:** on an authenticated internal Electron Chromium session,
browser_navigate, browser_snapshot and browser_extract_items succeeded, while
subsequent mutating interaction was replaced by durable_compile_required.
Attempting to express the work as durable execution then exposed
PREFLIGHT_REQUIRED/verifier requirements unsuitable for the unknown stateful UI
step, plus a native_browser route-constraint namespace mismatch in one path.

**Confirmed architectural contributors on current code:**

- prepare_turn_work() stores a broad _work_batch_candidate boolean;
- requires_compilation() can use that boolean to reject any later non-read /
  non-interactive effect, rather than only the repeated operation;
- unknown browser builtins conservatively become MUTATION in tools.effects,
  while another guardrail list can classify browser_console differently;
- route comparison does not universally normalize browser tool names to the
  canonical native_browser route;
- deterministic preflight assumes durable mutation/readback semantics that are
  correct for fan-out but too strong as a prerequisite for discovering a novel
  stateful UI workflow.

**Target invariant:** safe authorized novel work may make bounded adaptive
progress; homogeneous repeated mutations still require compiler/canary; learned
stable segments progressively move to compiled/routine execution.

**Do not fix by:** making arbitrary browser JS read-only, disabling canary,
allowing blind retry, weakening TaskRun/browser leases, adding a second memory or
authority store, or globally bypassing work_execute.

**Canonical design:**

## KI-012 — Upstream-derived ownership/resync/Kanban/recovery gaps [OPEN — 2026-09-18]

A direct comparison of high-value upstream PRs with current Hermes Work found
several concrete downstream gaps that are independent of KI-011's compiler-policy
obstruction. They share one failure class: canonical work can be correct locally
while ownership, resync, liveness, provenance or recovery at an adjacent boundary
lies or loses state.

**Confirmed open code gaps:**

- `tools/browser_supervisor.py`: post-attach CDP reconnect is unbounded
  (#114897);
- `hermes_cli/active_sessions.py`: no strict one-writer-per-`session_id`
  invariant and no foreign-owner transfer fence/read-only resume (#111493);
- `apps/desktop/src/lib/inflight-turn-journal.ts`: recovery can choose an
  earlier sealed stream-looking row instead of the last live projection
  (#115068);
- `use-background-sync.ts`: background reconciliation can drop an
  unacknowledged optimistic user row (#115085);
- Kanban task provenance can still accept an ambient session id without proving
  persistence in the active profile's SessionDB/request context (#114785);
- automatic Kanban heartbeat reports attempt rather than requiring durable
  success and does not yet fence delegated-child liveness (#114793);
- worker exit classification has strong downstream policy but its reaped exit
  evidence is process-local, so a different dispatcher can classify the same
  death differently (#114904).

**Important non-root-causes / non-actions:**

- Do not treat #114964 as proof BrowserTask keepalive is missing. H004 already
  proves real Electron WebContents identity across hide/show and park/show and
  H013 covers the integrated path. Reuse/extend those probes instead of creating
  another browser owner/harness.
- Do not port #114986 while the downstream Desktop gateway lacks the upstream
  `turnLeases` mechanism it fixes.
- Do not port #115056 as a second native snapshot system; the Electron runtime
  already performs its principal inventory in one `executeJavaScript` call.

**Required action:** implement in P0.0 → P0.4 order from
[UPSTREAM_RELIABILITY_HARDENING_2026-09-18.md](UPSTREAM_RELIABILITY_HARDENING_2026-09-18.md)
and close each sub-gap only with the focused regression named there. H-065 in
the engineering journal is the anti-repeat evidence ledger.


This file records observed/reproduced gaps and the evidence boundary around them. A listed symptom is **not** permission to assume a root cause; verify current `main` and any explicitly named candidate before changing code.

## KI-002 — Preview and Workstation Browser are separate browser lanes

**Observed:** Preview and the main Browser surface can show different independently navigated pages for what the user regards as one web task.

**Do not fix by:** synchronizing URLs between two pages.

**Target invariant:** Workstation-mode Preview compatibility and Browser Hub/Chat Browser View reference one BrowserTask/live page.

**Current status:** the MVP invariant is resolved. Chat Browser View, Browser
Hub and Workstation Preview reuse the same BrowserTask/runtime identity, and
the single-host transfer path is covered by
`apps/desktop/electron/workstation-browser-runtime-viewport.test.ts` plus the
packaged GUI smoke. Full Preview action parity, richer layouts and exhaustive
reconnect/compatibility coverage remain follow-up hardening rather than a
second browser lane.

## KI-004 — Native browser surface can overlap another Desktop pane

**Observed:** during bootstrap validation, independent Preview and Workstation Browser surfaces could visually overlap and resizing changed the overlap.

**Current evidence:** the Browser renderer already uses `ResizeObserver` and `getBoundingClientRect`, so “add another resize observer” is not an established fix.

**Target invariant:** one live `WebContentsView` host at a time plus an explicit host/viewport ownership contract; validate resize, maximize/restore, sidebar/pane changes, and host transfer.

**Current status:** the shared-surface overlap invariant is resolved.
`viewportHost` and `transferViewport()` move the same `WebContentsView` between
Hub and Chat, while host-aware `setBounds` rejects stale geometry from a
non-owner pane. The focused runtime tests cover host rejection, zoom/clamp
normalization and cross-window rehoming. The runtime also reconciles the active
view on native window resize/maximize/restore events, and H013 validates that
matrix against a real hidden Electron/Chromium view. More complex pane races,
compositor transitions and broader native composition evidence remain open
hardening work.

## KI-006 — Broad Windows Desktop suites contain pre-existing portability/test failures [RESOLVED]

**Observed:** after the canonical-source installer reached a clean install and passing Desktop typecheck, the broad UI and Electron/platform suites remained red on Windows.

**Causality status:** **not caused by the Workstation canonical-source / BrowserTask changes based on controlled baseline evidence.** A native-Windows side-by-side comparison used baseline `ce78f120e8ed2974d6174e475cc7572afcfe41e0` and Implementation 4 candidate `2ffee2335b6aba071e7b63457a047cd9334d4d92` under the same Windows/toolchain/install/test conditions.

Observed comparison:

- baseline UI legacy: 5 failed files / 11 failed tests;
- candidate UI legacy: 5 failed files / 9 failed tests;
- baseline platform/Electron legacy: 11 failed files / 33 failed tests;
- candidate platform/Electron legacy: 10 failed files / 28 failed tests;
- remaining candidate failures were identical baseline failures or variants of the same causal class around Windows path/permission assumptions, SSH ControlPath/Include assumptions, POSIX virtualenv layout, WSL/bridge timing, staging/file-mode assumptions, and locale-sensitive UI expectations;
- candidate-specific BrowserTask suite passed 2 files / 16 tests and candidate typecheck passed.

Controlled verdict: `WINDOWS_BASELINE_COMPARISON=PASS_WITH_KI-006_RED`.

The accepted PR head `75d10d35d4757496390debf8e4b4f9efb44c5432` changed no BrowserTask product/runtime/probe/workflow/dependency code after that controlled candidate; only contributor-attribution mapping and Workstation journal material were added. Its final Windows workflow again passed committed integration validation, install, checkout-clean, typecheck and focused BrowserTask diagnostics before the final broad aggregator remained red. No new Implementation 4 failure class was introduced.

On BrowserSessionState accepted head
`d5be442021ea0c744351622317eef5212219786d`, the scoped static checks,
5 focused files / 46 tests and H010 native probe all passed. The broad run had
one UI failure from a missing `BROWSER_ROUTE` test mock and 31 Electron failures
across unrelated POSIX path/mode/symlink/SSH/platform assumptions. This is the
current exact-head manifestation of the same KI-006 class, not a
BrowserSessionState failure.

**Resolution on the current working tree (HW-018, 2026-09-11):** the
underlying Windows contracts were fixed and validated without disabling or
deleting coverage:

- deterministic English locale formatting now keeps UI output stable across
  host locales, and the new-session Preview promotion preserves tabs when the
  stored session id arrives after the runtime session;
- POSIX fixture paths use an explicit path adapter, while Windows venv paths
  use Windows grammar;
- POSIX mode assertions now remain strict on POSIX and validate the Windows
  ACL-preserving/writable contract instead of requiring meaningless Node mode
  bits;
- Git path comparisons use native physical paths and non-repository probes
  avoid leaving Windows cwd handles locked;
- SSH ControlMaster tests opt into mux behavior explicitly, while no-mux
  behavior remains covered separately;
- WSL UNC selection no longer performs a blocking synchronous network share
  probe, and native staging tests verify the requested executable mode through
  an injected boundary.

Validation: Desktop UI **591 files / 5,669 tests passed**; Desktop
platform/Electron **126 files / 1,778 tests passed, 5 skipped**; Desktop
typecheck passed. The baseline comparison above remains historical evidence;
KI-006 is no longer an open failure on this working tree.

## KI-007 — `Session not found` / exported `session: null`

**Observed:** session export/logging from the browser validation cycle included a consistent message `session_id` while the exported session object was `null`, and logs previously included HTTP 404 `Session not found`.

**Causality status:** **unproven**. Preview/browser behavior has independent reproduced gaps, so this issue must not be used as their explanation without a causal trace.

**Required proof before any SessionDB/Gateway change:** reproduce on current `main` → identify endpoint/caller/session id → determine lineage/compression/rotation expectations → identify the responsible line/race → add regression test → only then change core.

**Current audit result (2026-09-15):** a deterministic provider-free regression
scenario now creates a session, binds task/browser metadata, persists
user/assistant/tool messages, finalizes, closes/reconnects through separate
handles, exports the session/lineage and exercises concurrent close/export plus
rotation-like writer activity. It passed in
`tests/hermes_state/test_ki007_session_export.py`; `export_session()` never
returned `session: null`. KI-007 therefore remains **NOT_REPRODUCED / evidence
gap**, and no SessionDB rewrite is justified.

## KI-008 — V3 product-level acceptance evidence is still open

**Observed:** the V3.1–V3.4 Python contract layer is implemented and validated,
including a Windows process-boundary smoke, and bounded native Browser plus
real headless-backend reconnect soaks now pass. The roadmap still requires
clean-machine release qualification, full event/resource parity beyond the
current clients and full-duration/production-scale Desktop/Browser load. The
Chromium/Firefox/Edge browser smoke is now validated separately when Edge is
available.

**Causality status:** **not a product failure; evidence boundary is explicit.**
The contract tests do not prove behavior that they do not exercise. The
historical KI-006 Desktop portability debt is resolved on the current working
tree, while the remaining V3 release evidence gates are still separate.

**Required action:** run the Windows clean-machine release workflow (which now
emits candidate-matched install/build evidence and the configured H013
hidden-window Desktop/Browser load gate, including its bounded 16-task/
120-second candidate profile (locally validated, but still unqualified on a
clean candidate) and the full-duration/production-scale
Desktop/Browser load gate on a candidate release, and extend client parity as new supported
surfaces are added, before promoting V3.1–V3.4 from “contract layer validated”
to fully accepted. Do not mark those gates green from unit-test coverage alone;
the bounded H011/H012 probes and local H013 integrated E2E are evidence, not a
substitute for the clean-machine/release-candidate gate.

## KI-009 — Packaged Desktop GUI E2E target initialization [RESOLVED]

**Original symptom:** the packaged Windows artifact loaded its real renderer,
but Playwright's Electron `beforeAll` waited for a detached Workstation
`WebContentsView` target and ended at the 90-second hook timeout.

**Resolution:** Workstation controller startup no longer creates a browser view
until the UI or a `browser_*` action needs one. The E2E fixture isolates
`HERMES_WORKSTATION_HOME`, injects the Electron loader for the custom packaged
executable and tolerates only 1 px of native subpixel geometry rounding.

**Evidence:** the original packaged GUI gate passed **5 passed (26.4s)**;
the latest run including the shared-resource identity check passed **6 passed
(28.3s)**.

## Resolved regression classes

### KI-010 — Vault paths were contained only after write [RESOLVED]

**Original symptom:** `VaultManager.write_note(..., subfolder=...)` created the
resolved directory and wrote the note before `relative_to(vault_dir)` proved
containment, allowing traversal/absolute-path side effects outside a custom or
default Vault root.

**Resolved behavior:** path input is parsed with host and Windows grammar,
containment is proved before directory/file mutation, symlinked files and
directories are excluded from scanning and mutation, and note replacement is
atomic. The process-wide canonical manager also runs a bounded debounced
watcher so external Markdown create/edit/rename/delete changes rebuild the
same index used by tools and Desktop RPC.

**Evidence:** `workstation/tests/test_vault.py` covers traversal, POSIX/Windows/
UNC absolute paths, malformed titles, normal/custom roots, file/directory
symlink escape where the host permits symlink creation, atomic CRUD and watcher
lifecycle/external changes.

### KI-003 — Complete logical BrowserSessionState did not survive restart

**Original symptom:** the persistent Chromium profile and BrowserTask-only
metadata existed, but ordinary logical tab ordering, active selection, safe
restorable metadata and one composite restart projection were incomplete.

**Resolved behavior:** PR #11 promoted one versioned atomic
BrowserSessionState containing ordinary/task logical tabs, order, active state,
sanitized URL/title metadata and the BrowserTask snapshot. It preserves the
latest intended composite across failed writes, migrates legacy task state once,
parks restored tasks and lazily recreates exactly one page.

Promotion:

- accepted head: `d5be442021ea0c744351622317eef5212219786d`;
- merge commit: `e0a99ef3aba6e6d2b65c30cf3c908ee1d49c4d29`;
- focused evidence: 5 files / 46 tests;
- native evidence: `H010_CLASSIFICATION=VALIDATED`, including clean and abrupt
  two-process restart, profile separation, failed-write convergence and
  explicit-destroy failure cleanup.

**Boundary retained:** a WebContentsView/renderer heap never survives process
restart. Controller/session/run/card identity expansion and host state belong to
V1 #1.5/V1 #5, not a second BrowserSessionState owner.

### KI-005 — BrowserTask lifecycle was implicit on pre-Implementation-4 `main`

**Original symptom:** `ownerTaskId`, `taskTabs`, parking, and attach/detach existed, but there was no complete first-class `show`/`hide`/`park`/`destroy` BrowserTask contract.

**Resolved behavior on current `main`:** PR #9 formalized BrowserTask around the existing `taskTabs`/`BrowserEntry.ownerTaskId` ownership primitives without introducing a second page store. `hide` and `park` preserve a live page, `show` re-exposes it, repeated task creation is idempotent, missing pages recover under the same logical task, and `destroyTask` is explicit.

Promotion:

- accepted PR head: `75d10d35d4757496390debf8e4b4f9efb44c5432`;
- merge commit on `main`: `fada723f43613e5e0f061cab24445573ac298998`.

**Automated regression coverage:**

- `apps/desktop/electron/workstation-browser-task.test.ts`;
- `apps/desktop/electron/workstation-browser-runtime-task.test.ts`;
- focused BrowserTask step in `Workstation Browser Windows`.

**Real native evidence:** `workstation/context/engineering-journal/probes/h004-native-browser-task-smoke.mjs` ran on Windows `10.0.26200`, Electron `40.10.2`, repository head `d8acc752133b125b9619cbc7fe09199f1283a22b` and emitted:

- `H004_LIVE_DESTROY_PASS`;
- `H004_RESTART_PASS`;
- `H004_CLASSIFICATION=VALIDATED`.

The native smoke proved same-page identity across hide/show and park/show, explicit destruction, two-process logical restart restoration/recreation, exactly-one-page ownership, and structural secret isolation.

**Carry-forward evidence:** Git comparison established that changes between the native-smoke/code-bearing evidence and the final accepted PR head did not alter the exercised BrowserTask product/runtime/probe behavior. Final-head Workstation CI and focused gates passed; broad Windows red retained only KI-006 baseline debt. KI-005 is therefore closed on promoted `main`.

### KI-001 — Desktop Browser capability could disappear from the model schema

**Resolved behavior:** Desktop/GUI Browser surface capability is derived from active Gateway session context instead of process-global Desktop identity or controller reachability. Selected Workstation-routed browser schemas remain present during controller startup/reachability races, while controller health/recovery governs execution. The tool-definition cache includes the session capability fingerprint so Desktop results cannot leak into TUI/CLI.

**Security/ownership boundary:** only the narrow set of actions actually routed through the embedded Workstation Browser is force-preserved, and only when those names are already selected by active toolsets. `browser_exec` is not promoted. TUI/CLI sessions do not gain Desktop capability merely from `HERMES_DESKTOP=1`.

**Regression coverage:** `tests/tui_gateway/test_workstation_browser_schema_capability.py`.

### RI-001 — Normal Workstation install rewrote tracked source before validation

**Resolved behavior:** the normal installer treats the committed downstream tree as canonical. It validates integration in read-only mode, installs isolated dependencies, prepares runtime state outside tracked source, and compares Git status before/after installation.

**Evidence:** canonical-source validation on Implementation 2 and subsequent Workstation CI/Windows install gates.

## Closing an issue here

When an issue is fixed, move it to the resolved section with the validated behavior and test/evidence boundary. Do not delete the historical symptom if it documents a regression class that future tests protect.

## Canonical Work Loop Reliability Gaps — RESOLVED (2026-09-17)

The canonical execution reliability gate resolved and verified the identified causal gaps:

### KI-007 — Stale run late completion could corrupt task state [RESOLVED]
**Resolved behavior:** `workstation/kanban.py::complete_task_with_report` enforces `expected_run_id` CAS checks. Stale runs from superseded attempts are rejected immediately before acceptance evaluation or mutation, and late reports cannot mutate canonical task state. Covered by `test_stale_run_late_completion_rejected`.

### KI-008 — Terminal parents left live descendants [RESOLVED]
**Resolved behavior:** `DurableTaskStore.update_plan_state` cascades terminal states (`interrupted`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `blocked`) to mark all live descendant items as `blocked`. Startup and periodic reconciliation is provided by `reconcile_terminal_plans()`. Covered by `test_terminal_parent_reconciliation_cases_a_and_b`.

### KI-009 — Missing canonical lineage across WorkPlans and reports [RESOLVED]
**Resolved behavior:** Canonical lineage fields (`run_id`, `execution_key`, `operation_id`) are now first-class on `WorkPlan`, `WorkItem`, `ExecutionEvent`, `BrowserTaskReport`, and `TaskOutcome`, with backward-compatible SQLite migrations. Exposed via `task_cockpit()`. Covered by `test_workplan_persists_canonical_lineage_run_and_execution_key` and `test_task_cockpit_exposes_canonical_lineage`.

### KI-010 — O(N^2) ExecutionJournal append scaling degradation [RESOLVED]
**Resolved behavior:** `ExecutionJournal.append()` utilizes `_get_last_record()` to achieve $O(1)$ streaming hash chaining without parsing the full journal file on each append. Verified under 120-event stress test in `test_journal_100_events_streaming_hash_integrity`.

All 30 seed cases in `work100.py` pass with 0 coverage gaps, and all 452
Workstation tests pass with 2 expected skips.
