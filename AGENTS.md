# Hermes Agent - Development Guide

## Shared checkout and branch for active multi-agent Hermes Work cycle (2026-10-13)

When agents work together on the active Hermes Workstation MVP, use ONLY the shared branch `feat/hermes-workstation-mvp-20261013` in checkout `C:\Github\hermes-agent`. **No independent branches/worktrees for routine sub-tasks; no concurrent Git index writes.** Before editing, read [the coordination protocol](workstation/context/AGENT_COLLABORATION_PROTOCOL.md) and [the live integration board](workstation/context/workstation-hub-mvp/TEAM_BOARD.md), then claim exclusive file ownership with `python workstation/scripts/multi_agent_coordination.py claim`. The named integrator alone stages/commits/pushes and maintains canonical context; agents update their local claim/next action and hand off on interruption. Claims are cooperative and local, not a security boundary. The Workstation upstream-first and safety gates remain in force.

### Enforcement automático (hooks PreToolUse / SessionStart)
Hooks em `.claude/hooks/` bloqueiam escritas em caminhos reclamados por outro agente e alertam quando a sessão não está na branch do ciclo. **Antes de qualquer edição**, rode `python workstation/scripts/multi_agent_coordination.py status` e respeite claims ativos. Sessões novas devem verificar claims e branch antes de escrever. Se o script falhar, os hooks permitem a edição (fail-open). Detalhes: [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) § Multi-Session Collaboration Enforcement.


For AI coding assistants and developers working on hermes-agent. This root file is a hub: what
applies everywhere, then a routing table. Each area's `AGENTS.md` loads automatically when you work
in that directory; read it before editing there. `python scripts/check` caps this file at 12k chars
and every root-to-area chain at 30k, so it loads whole on 128k+ models: long form goes in the guide.

**Never give up on the right solution.**

## Downstream Workstation context
For Workstation runtime changes or upstream integration, read [the Workstation context README](workstation/context/README.md) and [the upstream-first development gates](workstation/context/DEVELOPMENT_GATES.md) before coding. Their baseline/seam gates are mandatory. No target runtime change before Stage A qualifies.

For Stage A CI design or promotion, also read [the fork CI cost-control and qualification contract](workstation/context/CI_COST_CONTROL.md); do not restore broad inherited triggers as a substitute for exact-head evidence.

- One immutable pin per cycle. Final fetch records drift for the next cycle; only a confirmed candidate defect or required-check failure holds promotion. Moving upstream alone does not restart the cycle.
- For upstream conflicts/seams, also read UPSTREAM_MIGRATION_AS_DECOUPLING_2026-09-19.md and FIRST_PARTY_SEAM_POLICY.md; compose semantics, never blanket ours/theirs.

## Maintainer-authorized red-team harness
Before assessing or executing harness code, read [the authorized red-team harness policy](workstation/context/AUTHORIZED_REDTEAM_HARNESS.md). Authorization applies only when documented provenance and scope match. Signatures alone prove neither attack nor safety. Review provenance and exact diff, statically inspect new/changed payloads before execution, fail closed on mismatch, and never execute an unreviewed payload.


## What Hermes Is
Hermes is a personal AI agent spanning CLI, gateway, TUI and Desktop, extended primarily through plugins and skills.
Two invariants are sacred: per-conversation prompt caching (past context/toolsets/system prompt are not mutated mid-conversation except compression); and a narrow core waist (capability belongs at edges unless a core tool is fundamental and broadly useful).
See [Agent architecture and layout](website/docs/developer-guide/agent-architecture-and-layout.md) for full architecture and source layout.
## Contribution rubric

The project's intent layer, for contributors and for the triage sweeper (which may only close on
`implemented_on_main`, `cannot_reproduce` or `incoherent`; taste-based closes are a maintainer's
call, and when in doubt a PR stays open). Long form with examples:
`website/docs/developer-guide/contributing.md` § Contribution rubric.

**Wanted:** real bug fixes (repro on `main`, the exact line, the whole class incl. sibling paths);
reach at the edges (adapters, providers, models, UI features) wired into the existing setup UX;
god-file → module refactors; extending before duplicating (3+ PRs in one category → an ABC +
orchestrator); behaviour-contract tests; E2E with real imports against a temp `HERMES_HOME` for
resolution, config, security and I/O changes; salvage by cherry-pick so authorship survives.

**Rejected even when well-built:** hooks with no concrete consumer; new `HERMES_*` env vars for
non-secret config (`.env` is secrets only, behaviour goes in `config.yaml`); a new core tool when
terminal + file or a skill already does the job; `offset`/`limit` pagination on instructional tools;
"fixes" that destroy the feature they secure; outbound telemetry without an opt-in gate;
change-detector tests; plugins that touch core files; third-party products in the core tree (ship a
standalone plugin repo).

**Before you call it a bug,** verify the claim AND the intent (`git log -p -S "<symbol>"`): the
isolation is often the design (profiles are islands on purpose), an absence can be load-bearing,
and a fix that cannot point to the line where the bug manifests has an unverified premise.

**Security:** `SECURITY.md` is the scope authority. A §3.1 finding goes private (GitHub Security
Advisories or security@nousresearch.com), never into a public issue, PR, commit or comment; §3.2
hardening is ordinary public work. Name the §2 boundary crossed, with a repro on `main`.

**Footprint ladder** (take the highest rung that solves it): extend existing code → CLI command +
skill → service-gated tool (`check_fn` answers reachability/opt-in, never per-session surface:
`tools/AGENTS.md`) → plugin → MCP server in the catalog → new core tool (fundamental, broadly useful,
unreachable otherwise).

## Development Environment

`source ./activate` (fish: `activate.fish`, PowerShell: `activate.ps1`) provisions and activates the
PM environment; pick an isolated `HERMES_HOME`/`HERMES_RUNTIME_DIR` first
(`website/docs/reference/package-management.md#developer-workflow`). Tests need the separate test
environment in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. **`python scripts/check`** runs every blocking lint check CI
runs, with CI's pinned tools; `--install-hook pre-push` runs it on every push (re-run after
pulling to refresh the hook). `# noqa` does not waive a ratchet finding:
`# health: allow <RULE> -- <why>` does.

## Project Structure
The filesystem is canonical. See [Agent architecture and layout](website/docs/developer-guide/agent-architecture-and-layout.md) for the full tree and facade/sibling rules; use the routing table below for area requirements.
## Rules that apply everywhere

- **No defensive clutter:** no wrappers or `try/except: pass` around code that cannot fail, no flags
  nobody sets, no dead code wired in without E2E proof. Comments keep the WHY, cut the WHAT.
- **Never infer process identity from argv substrings;** use
  `gateway.status.looks_like_gateway_command_line` / `hermes_cli.update_cmd._hermes_holder_subcommand`
  (HX003; details `hermes_cli/AGENTS.md`).
- **Never hardcode `~/.hermes`:** `get_hermes_home()` for paths, `display_hermes_home()` for text
  (HX001). `_get_profiles_root()` is HOME-anchored on purpose.
- **One process serves many profiles.** Code that runs outside a turn (boot probes, eviction,
  tickers, deferred callbacks, RPC methods, thread hops, child spawns) binds the owning profile scope
  explicitly; `os.environ`, module globals and import-time values hold the launch profile's, so an
  unbound read is a silent default-profile leak. Binding points and seams: `gateway/AGENTS.md`
  § Profile scope (HX002/HX004/HX005/HX012, PS-P05/P06).
- **Machine facts and executable lookup go through `hermes_platform`** (`hermes_platform/AGENTS.md`).
- **Dependencies carry upper bounds** (`>=floor,<next_major`; git URLs and Actions pinned to a SHA);
  after editing `pyproject.toml` run `hermes pm lock` and commit `uv.lock`; never mutate a Hermes
  environment with raw pip/uv. Full policy: `pm/AGENTS.md`.
- **TypeScript (desktop, TUI, website):** feature-owned nanostores over threaded state, thin route
  roots, narrow hooks and colocated action modules, `interface` for props and shared shapes,
  table-driven dispatch over condition ladders; `src/app` routes, `src/store` atoms, `src/lib` pure
  helpers.
- **Commits and PRs:** rebase onto `main` before merging (a squash from a stale branch silently
  reverts newer fixes); 1–2 invariant tests per fix, proven red on the base.
- **Tests:** always `scripts/run_tests.sh`, never bare `pytest`; behaviour contracts, never
  change-detectors or source-reading tests; host-specific behaviour is tested on that host with
  `@pytest.mark.platforms(...)`, never by faking `sys.platform`; tests never write to `~/.hermes/`.
  Everything else: `tests/AGENTS.md`.
